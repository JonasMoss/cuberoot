Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Estimators with cube root asymptotics are typically the result of M-estimation
 with non-smooth objective functions.
 Aside from being inefficient, they are hard to calculate, have intractable
 limiting distributions, and are unamenable to the bootstrap.
 Manski's maximum score estimator and irregular histograms receive special
 attention.
 We investigate the geometry, algorithmics and robustness properties of
 Manski's maximum score estimator, a semiparametric estimator of the coefficient
s in the binary response model.
 We provide a new exact algorithm for its computation in covariate dimension
 one and two.
 This is faster than other algorithms described in the statistical literature.
 The breakdown point in covariate dimension one is derived, and we make
 progress towards finding it in higher dimensions.
 The breakdown points are highly dependent on the underlying data generating
 mechanism.
 Irregular histograms on the unit interval are also a major theme of this
 thesis.
 These are obtained through the minimisation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence
 and integrated squared distance.
 For smooth densities, we derive the limit distributions of the split points
 estimates for four classes of irregular histograms.
 Different conditions on the underlying density leads to different rates
 of convergence, with cube root being the norm.
 The computational challenges involved in finding these histograms are discussed
, and some anomalies associated with them are investigated.
 Also, it is indicated how one can proceed in order to show consistency
 of these density estimators.
 Finally we derive the 
\emph on
CIC
\emph default
 (cube root information criterion), a cousin of the AIC.

\begin_layout Standard
The subject of this thesis was decided upon after Nils and I talked about
 a specific regression problem.
 Assume we have a regression 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=m(x_{i})+\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}\in[0,1]$
\end_inset

 for simplicity.
 Questions in the social sciences sometimes take the form 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 an increasing function?
\begin_inset Quotes erd

.
 Let's take an example from the paper is

 In team sports like football, baseball and basketball, it seems very plausible
 that teams get better as they get more talented players.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a measurement of the talentedness of team 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}$

 is its objective outcome (e.g.
 number of games won), then 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=m(x_{i})+\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the model, and

 There is, to me, no obvious way to attack this problem, which is why I
 brought it up.

Since these estimators are well-known for having cube root asymptotics,
 it suddenly became the theme of my thesis! This theme couldn't have been

 for many years.

\begin_layout Standard
Among all warlike estimators in statistics, far most have square root asymptotic
s: An estimator 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\theta}_{n}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 has square root asymptotics if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}(\widehat{\theta}_{n}-\theta)\tod Y$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is a non-degenerate random variable.
 Typically, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is normally distributed with some 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 dependent on the features of the underlying distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 This kind of limiting distribution appears e.g.
 when we use maximum likelihood, Bayes estimators, 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

-estimators and the generalised method of moments.
 Estimators with cube root asymptotics, on the other hand, satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\frac{1}{3}}(\widehat{\theta}_{n}-\theta)\tod Y$
\end_inset

 for some non-degenerate random 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 Instead of being normal, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is typically distributed as the maximiser of a non-degenerate zero-mean
 Gaussian process with drift.
 Frequentely, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is a scaled variant of 
\begin_inset Formula $\argmax_{t}\left[W(t)-t^{2}\right]$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is a two-sided Browian motion originating from 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 Such variables are distributed according to  
\emph on
Chernoff's distribution.
 
\emph default
There is also at least one elementary case where we have
\emph on
 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-asymptotics
\emph default
, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\theta}_{n}=\max X_{i}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim}\mathcal{U}(0,\theta)$
\end_inset

.
 Normalizing, we get the convergence 
\begin_inset Formula $n(\frac{\widehat{\theta}_{n}-\theta}{\theta})\to\exp(1)$
\end_inset

.
 More generally, this phenomenon obtains whenever the underlying 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is smooth all the way to a break point.
 There are no similarly simple examples of cube root asymptotics, however.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cube root asymptotics fall into roughly three cases:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Maximum likelihood for distributions having specific features.
 Two examples are Grenander's estimator and isotonic regression.
 Under the assumption that 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is a decreasing density, Grenander's estimator is the left derivative of
 the concave majorant of the empirical distribution function.
 If smoothness assumptions on 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 are satisfied, the estimator has cube root asymptotics.

Approximation by step functions: The largest chapter (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

) of this thesis is on the subject of 
\emph on
irregular histograms
\emph default
, wherein the split points are shown to converge at the 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\frac{1}{3}}$
\end_inset

 rate provided the underlying 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 possesses a derivative.
 A similar concept is that of decision trees, or regression histograms,
 discussed in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Binary-decision-trees"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A feature these estimators have in common is their attempt to measure something
 smooth by using something discrete.
 For instance, both Grenander's estimator and histograms approximate a smooth
 density with a step function.
 Manski's score estimator estimates the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

s in a binary choice regression model by maximising a step function; binary
 decision trees estimate a smooth regression model with a step function.
 We can make this more precise.
 These estimators are typically 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

-estimators, with objective 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\theta}$
\end_inset

.
 The underlying mechanism is that 
\begin_inset Formula $Pm_{\theta}=\int m_{\theta}dP$
\end_inset

 is smooth in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, but 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}m_{\theta}=n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{\theta}(X_{i})$
\end_inset

 is not.
 Most 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

-estimators are constructed in a manner which makes this impossible.
 The culprit in cube root asymptotics is the introduction of indicator functions
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\theta}$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\theta}=1_{[x-\frac{1}{2}\theta,x+\frac{1}{2}\theta]}$
\end_inset

 for Chernoff's mode estimator of Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sub:Heuristics-and-examples"

\end_inset

, a section contains more about the heuristics of cube root asymptotics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sometimes, when we replace the smoothness assumptions on 
\begin_inset Formula $Pm_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 with discreteness assumptions, we gain 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-convergence instead.
 This happens for decision trees and is likely to happen for irregular histogram
s as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other common features of cube root asymptotics are:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
In higher dimensions, the limit distributions are intractable both analytically
 and numerically.
 In one dimension, the limiting distribution can frequently be described
 as a rescaled Chernoff's distribution, typically involving several nuisance
 parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Inconsistency of the bootstrap.
 Fortunately, the subsample and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-out-of-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 bootstrap is still consistent.
 We will have more to say on this in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Resampling"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The estimates are computationally expensive to find, at least in higher
 dimensions.
 Finding them typically requires combinatorial optimisation, with methods
 like Newton-Raphson being next to useless.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Even for big 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the distance between the sampling distribution and the limiting distribution
 is large.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Add to all these the fact that cube roots give a tremendous loss in efficiency
 compared to other reasonable procedures, like local polynomial regression
 instead of decision trees, ordinary linear regression instead of least
 median of squares regression, and kernel smoothers instead of irregular
 histograms, and we have the reason why these estimators are not very popular.
 An attractive feature of these estimators is often that they have fewer
 assumptions, and sometimes other nice properties: Manski's maximum score
 estimator is consistent under very broad assumptions, it is robust, and
 it has been shown that there exist 
\emph on
no 
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}$
\end_inset

-consistent estimator of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Beta}$
\end_inset

s in the binary response model under these assumptions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "chamberlain1986asymptotic"

\end_inset

.
 Also, Rousseeuw's least median of squares estimator is the most outlier
 robust linear regression estimator there is, and irregular histograms are
 likely to be 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

-consistent for any underlying density on 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

, are easy to interpret, and require little space to store (when compared
 to KDEs, which essentially require the entire set of observations).
 Still, the study of cube root asymptotics has mostly been theoretical,
 with some papers on the bootstrap appearing in later years.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The combination of the points 1.) and 2.) above is especially pernicious,
 as it leaves no obvious method for calculating confidence intervals and
 doing hypothesis tests.
 This can sometimes, as in the case of Manski's estimator and (probably)
 irregular histograms, be rectified by smoothing.
 Also, the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-out-of-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 bootstrap and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-subsampling are consistent in general, but they require a choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 The choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is usually done by a kind of cross validation approach, which requires
 the calculation of countless estimates.
 In addition, these methods often require a large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 in order to work well.
 This combined with 3.) makes it infeasible to use these two resampling approache
s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
An outline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Roughly speaking, we will devote Chapter 2 to cube root asymptotics in general,
 while the the succeeding chapters are devoted to two more worked-out examples:
 Manski's maximum score estimator 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "manski1975maximum"

\end_inset

 and irregular histograms on the unit interval 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "rozenholc2010combining"

\end_inset

.
 These investigations are meant as theoretical exercises, and the estimators
 are not applied on any non-trivial data sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Chapter 2 we briefly discuss some of the general theory required for
 proving cube root convergence.
 This is the theory of M-estimation and empirical processes, where most
 is taken from van der Vaart and Wellner's excellent book 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Weak Convergence and Empirical Processes
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "van1996weak"

\end_inset

.
 The key result from this book is the rate theorem, which can be used to
 establish the limit distribution and prove the rate of convergence for
 any known estimator with cube root asymptotics.
 We will not be able to do this theory justice, but we will try to indicate
 where the results come from and what the difficulties are.
 We will also discuss the cube root heuristics of Kim & Pollard 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "kim1990cube"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "chernoff1964estimation"

\end_inset

, by means of a heuristic proof of the limiting distribution of Chernoff's
 mode estimator (ibid.), which is the most simple estimator in this category.
 This particular estimator illuminates the question of why cube root asymptotics
 occurs.
 Then we briefly describe the least median of squares estimator and binary
 decision trees 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "banerjee2007confidence"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, we will discuss resampling.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next chapter is about Manski's maximum score estimator (which we will
 often call 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Manski's estimator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), a semiparametric estimator of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

s in a binary response model.
 We will not focus on the asymptotics in this Chapter, as the algorithmics
 will be at the centre of our attention.
 An algorithm for its computation in one and two dimensions is discussed
 in detail, and we supply and implementation of it in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{C}++$

 In addition, we discuss its robustness properties and carry out some simulation
s.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Chapter 4, irregular histograms on the unit interval is the subject.
 This chapter forms the bulk of this thesis.
 First we discuss kernel density estimation on the unit interval, with a
 special focus on the Gaussian copula KDE of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "jones2007miscellanea"

\end_inset

.
 Secondly, we define a class of histograms and discuss some of their properties.
 Then our attention goes the question of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

-consistency for these histograms.
 In the succeeding section we find the limiting distribution of the 
\emph on
split points 
\emph default
of these histograms, which is our main application of theory of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

-estimation from Chapter 2.
 Also, we will discuss three different algorithms for the computation of
 the split points, and demonstrate the considerable advantage of pre-smoothing.
 We implement some of this in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{C}++/\mathtt{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally we discuss the 
\emph on
cube root information criterion 
\emph default
(CIC), an extension of the AIC to these classes of histograms.

\begin_layout Subsection
Theoretical basis

\begin_layout Standard
Given a probability space 
\begin_inset Formula $(\Omega,\F,P),$
\end_inset

 a stochastic variable is a map 
\begin_inset Formula $X:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 which is 
\begin_inset Formula $(\Sigma,\mathcal{\mathscr{B}}^{n})$
\end_inset

-measurable, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{\mathscr{B}}^{n}$
\end_inset

 is the Borel 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

-algebra on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

.
 The majority of classical results on convergence of stochastic variables
 depends on this measurability condition being satisfied.
 For instance, a sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 converges weakly to 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}\tod X$
\end_inset

, if 
\begin_inset Formula $P(X_{n}\leq x)\to P(X\leq x)$
\end_inset

 pointwise for every continuity point of 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)=P(X\leq x)$
\end_inset

.
 This definition requires something like 
\begin_inset Formula $(\Sigma,\mathcal{B})$
\end_inset

-measurability, as we need to assign probabilities to every set of the form
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}^{-1}(-\infty,x]$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, measurability is required for the concepts of convergence almost

In this thesis, we will encounter maps of the form

 where

 is some metric space, typically a non-separable Banach space.
 This lack of separability creates plenty of measurability issues.
 In the next example, it is illuminating to known that

 Let

 Let

 be the identity function on this interval, the uniform distribution on

 Now we define the function

\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $X\left(x\right)=1_{[U\leq x]}$

 This is gives us a map

 The classic approach, used in

It is a well known result that convergence in distribution can equivalently
 be formulated as weak*-convergence: A sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 converges in distribution to 
\begin_inset Formula $X\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 iff 
\begin_inset Formula $Ef(X_{n})\to Ef(X)$

 This definition extends nicely to the case when 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}$
\end_inset

 are elements of separable Banach spaces, but the measurability issues mentioned
 above makes it impossible to use this same definition of convergence when
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}$
\end_inset

 are elements of 
\emph on
non-separable
\emph default
 Banach spaces, like 
\begin_inset Formula $l^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$
\end_inset

.
 An appropriate extension is to define 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{\star}$
\end_inset

 as the least measurable majorant of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $E^{\star}(X)=E(X^{\star})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{D}$
\end_inset

 be a (non-separable) Banach space, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{n}\in\mathbb{D}$
\end_inset

 be random variables (not necessarily measurable).
 In addition, let 
\begin_inset Formula $X\in\mathbb{D}$

 be a measurable limit variable.
 Then

Throughout this thesis we use a functional notation for measures: When

 is a measure on a measure space 
\begin_inset Formula $(X,\Sigma)$

\begin_inset Formula $f:X\to\mathbb{R}$

\begin_inset Formula $\int f(x)dP(x)=Pf$

 This notation reflects the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\int\cdot dP$
\end_inset

 is a functional mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $f\to\int f(x)dP(x)$

 for each

\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}f=n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f(X_{i})$

 uniformly in

Donsker classes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While Glivenko-Cantelli results are uniform variants of the law of large
 numbers, Donsker results are uniform variants of the central limit theorem.
 These classes are named in honour of Monroe Donsker, who proved the uniform
 central limit theorem for the empirical distribution function.
 We are not interested in Donsker results in themselves, but they are needed
 in order to establish the limiting distributions of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

-estimators by means of the rate theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\[

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 is a non-degenerate and measurable random process.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The concept of bracketing entropy has its place here as well: The bracketing
 integral is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
J_{[]}(\delta,F,L_{2}(P))=\int_{0}^{\delta}\sqrt{\log N_{[]}(\epsilon,\mathcal{F},L_{2}(P))}d\epsilon,
\]

\end_inset

which we want to be bounded as 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\to\infty$
\end_inset

.
 This is a condition on the growth of the entropy as 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\to0$
\end_inset

, for since 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{[]}(\epsilon,\mathcal{F},L_{2}(P)=1$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is large enough, it is only the values close to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 that are of interest.
 This integral is important due to the following theorem, which is proved

\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\theta}\stackrel{p}{\to}\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$

 The most famous case of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

-estimation is that of maximum likelihood estimation, where 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\theta}=l_{\theta}$
\end_inset

, the log likelihood of a parametric model.
 
\begin_inset Formula $M$

-estimation is often associated with robust statistics, where one can use
 criterion functions other than the log likelihood in order to obtain estimators

 This approach was developed by

\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

-estimators in classical robust statistics.
 In the context of robust statistics, 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

-estimators has a more restricted meaning than ours, as only smooth choices
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\theta}$

 In this setting, both the asymptotics of 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\theta}$
\end_inset

 and its value can be obtained by differentiating 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}m_{\theta}$

\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}\frac{d}{d\theta}m_{\theta}=0$

Assume

 is differentiable at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 with a non-singular Hessian 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $K=Pm_{\theta}m_{\theta}^{T}$
\end_inset

 exists.
 Also assume some regularity conditions, most importantly that 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 is differentiable at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}(\widehat{\theta}-\theta)\tod N(0,J^{-1}KJ^{-1})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $h=\theta-\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Under some regularity and smoothness conditions we have 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
nP_{n}m_{\theta} & = & \sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{\theta}(X_{i})\\
 & \approx & \sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{\theta_{0}}(X_{i})+U(X_{i};\theta_{0})h+\frac{1}{2}h^{T}Jh+o(h^{2}),
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $U=\frac{d}{d\theta}m_{\theta}\mid_{\theta=\theta_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
 This yields the local centred likelihood process 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
M_{n}(\theta) & = & nP_{n}(m_{\theta_{0}+hn^{-\frac{1}{2}}}-m_{\theta_{0}})\\
 & = & \sqrt{n}h\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}U(X_{i};\theta_{0})\right]-\frac{1}{2}h^{T}Jh+o(|h|^{2}).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

This process converges to 
\begin_inset Formula $h^{T}Z-\frac{1}{2}h^{T}Jh$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\sim N(0,K)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K=\textrm{Var}U(X,\theta_{0})$
\end_inset

.
 Taking the derivative, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $KZ=Jh,$
\end_inset

 hence 
\begin_inset Formula $h=J^{-1}Z$
\end_inset

 maximises it, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}(\widehat{\theta}-\theta_{0})\tod N(0,J^{-1}KJ^{-1})$
\end_inset

 estimation.
 In the special case when 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{\theta}=\log g(\theta)$
\end_inset

, for some density 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

, we obtain the classical limit result on maximum likelihood estimators
 as a corollary.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $g=f$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $J=K$

Our investigations will deal with

-estimators where the smoothness assumption on

 The estimators will have associated criterion functions

\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}m_{\theta}=n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{\theta}(X_{i})$

 The median is natural to spend some time on: First of all, it appears non-smoot

 Chernoff's mode estimator is the simplest cube root estimator, and the

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 being the median of 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}=\argmin E(|X-\theta|)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Observe that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E(|X-\theta|) & = & \int_{\theta}^{\infty}(x-\theta)dF(x)+\int_{-\infty}^{\theta}(\theta-x)dF(x),\\
 & = & \int_{\theta}^{\infty}xdF(x)-\int_{-\infty}^{\theta}xdF(x)+\theta(2F(\theta)-1).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{d}{d\theta}\int_{\theta}^{\infty}xdF(x)=-\frac{d}{d\theta}\int_{-\infty}^{\theta}xdF(x)=\theta f(\theta)$
\end_inset

, this function is differentiable at 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 with derivative
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
-2\theta f(\theta)+(2F(\theta)-1)+2\theta f(\theta)=(2F(\theta)-1),
\]

\end_inset

consequently 
\begin_inset Formula $F(\theta_{0})=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

 as claimed.

 As above, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$

 The content of this theorem is well known, but this proof is the work of
 the author.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "thm:median theorem"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\theta}$
\end_inset

 be the sample median obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1},...,X_{n}$
\end_inset

 i.i.d.
 copies from a distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 with a non-zero density in the neighbourhood of the median.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n^{\frac{1}{2}}(\widehat{\theta}-\theta_{0})\tod N(0,(2f(\theta_{0})^{-2}).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
For simplicity we assume, throughout this proof, that 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta>\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 By decomposing the sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}m_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 as in Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:Median objective"

\end_inset

, we obtain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|X_{i}-\theta|=\frac{1}{n}\left[\sum_{X_{i}>\theta}X_{i}-\sum_{X_{i}<\theta}X_{i}+\theta(2\#\left\{ \theta>X_{i}\right\} -n)\right].
\]

\end_inset

Define lower, middle and upper random variables as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
L & = & \#\left\{ \theta_{0}>X_{i}\right\} ,\\
M & = & \#\left\{ \theta>X_{i}>\theta_{0}\right\} ,\\
U & = & \#\left\{ X_{i}>\theta\right\} .
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

We can understand 
\begin_inset Formula $(L,M,U)$
\end_inset

 as an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-multinomial vector with cell probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $F(\theta_{0}),\: F(\theta)-F(\theta_{0}),$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1-F(\theta)$
\end_inset

.
 Take note of the following, Taylor-derived observation: When 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\approx\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, the cell probability of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0})$
\end_inset

.
 By simple reasoning, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{n}=P_{n}m_{\theta}-P_{n}m_{\theta_{0}}$
\end_inset

 can be identified as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{n} & = & 2\sum_{\theta>X_{i}>\theta_{0}}(\theta-X_{k_{i}})+(\theta-\theta_{0})(2L-n),
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the indices of those 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{j}$
\end_inset

 satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta>X_{j}>\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{k_{j}}$
\end_inset

 is distributed according to the density 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)1_{[\theta_{0},\theta]}(F(\theta)-F(\theta_{0}))^{-1}$
\end_inset

, which equals 
\begin_inset Formula $(\theta-\theta_{0})^{-1}1_{[\theta_{0},\theta]}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}\approx\theta$
\end_inset

 by Taylor expansion.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta-X_{j}\sim\mathcal{U}(\theta_{0},\theta)$
\end_inset

.
 Denote these variables 
\begin_inset Formula $(\theta-\theta_{0})V_{j}$
\end_inset

, and use this to rewrite 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{n}Y_{n}$
\end_inset

 as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{n}Y_{n}=\frac{1}{n}2(\theta-\theta_{0})\sum_{i=1}^{M}V_{j}+\frac{1}{n}2(\theta-\theta_{0})(L-0.5n).
\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $EM=nf(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $EV_{i}=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E[\frac{1}{n}2(\theta-\theta_{0})\sum_{i=1}^{M}V_{i}]=f(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0})^{2}.
\]

\end_inset

An application of the law of total variance gives us
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{Var}(\sum_{i=1}^{M}V_{i}) & = & E(\mathrm{Var}(\sum_{i=1}^{M}V_{i})|M)+\mathrm{Var}(E(\sum_{i=1}^{M}V_{i})|M)\\
 & = & nf(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0})12^{-1}+4^{-1}nf(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0})(1-f(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0}))\\
 & = & 3^{-1}nf(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0}).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Where the higher order terms are discarded.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathrm{Var}[\frac{1}{n}2(\theta-\theta_{0})\sum_{i=1}^{M}V_{i}]=\frac{4}{3n}f(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0})^{3}.
\]

\end_inset

The term 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{n}2(\theta-\theta_{0})(L-0.5n)$
\end_inset

 is easily seen to be normally distributed in the limit: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{n}2(\theta-\theta_{0})(L-0.5n)\sim N(0,n{}^{-1}(\theta-\theta_{0})^{2}).
\]

\end_inset

Now we find the covariance between 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\frac{1}{n}2(\theta-\theta_{0})\sum_{i=1}^{M}V_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=\frac{1}{n}2(\theta-\theta_{0})(L-0.5n)$
\end_inset

 by using the law of total covariance,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y)=E(\mathrm{Cov(X,Y\mid M))+\mathrm{Cov}(E(X\mid M),\mathrm{Cov}(E(Y\mid M))}.
\]

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $E(\mathrm{Cov(X,Y\mid M))}=0$
\end_inset

, as 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 are conditionally independent given 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, 
\begin_inset Formula $E(X\mid M)=\frac{1}{n}(\theta-\theta_{0})M$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E(Y\mid M) & = & \frac{1}{n}2(\theta-\theta_{0})(\frac{F(\theta_{0})}{1-(F(\theta)-F(\theta_{0}))})(n-M)-0.5n)\\
 & = & \frac{1}{n}2(\theta-\theta_{0})(\frac{F(\theta_{0})}{1-f(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0})})(n-M)-0.5n),
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

and
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathrm{Var}M\approx nf(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0})(1-f(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0})),
\]

\end_inset

we obtain
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mathrm{Cov}(X,Y) & = & -\frac{2}{n^{2}}(\theta-\theta_{0})^{2}F(\theta_{0})\mathrm{Var}M,\\
 & \approx & -\frac{2}{n}(\theta-\theta_{0})^{3}F(\theta_{0})f(\theta_{0}).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Notice that the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is of higher order than the variance of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 Since the covariance is equally negligible, we obtain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{n}Y_{n}(\theta)\approx f(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0})^{2}+n^{-\frac{1}{2}}(\theta-\theta_{0})Z,
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\sim N(0,1)$
\end_inset

 is the same across all 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

s sufficiently close to 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 The case when 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta<\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 is similar and is omitted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Now make the substitution 
\begin_inset Formula $t=|\theta-\theta_{0}|$
\end_inset

 and differentiate 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{n}Y_{n}$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 This yields 
\begin_inset Formula $2f(\theta_{0})t+\frac{1}{2}n^{-\frac{1}{2}}Z,$
\end_inset

 which has its root at 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\frac{1}{2}}t=-\frac{1}{2f(\theta_{0})}Z.$
\end_inset

 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\frac{1}{2}}(\widehat{\theta}-\theta)\sim N(0,(2f(\theta))^{-2})$
\end_inset

, as claimed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Importantly, the 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

 in the previous proposition is constant across all 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 --- there is one dominating source of randomness, and it doesn't change
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 This happens because we manage to decompose the process into two parts,
 one of which has higher order variance than the other, where the dominating
 part depends linearly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 The kind of decomposition we arrived at in this theorem is impossible for
 cube root asymptotics: The Brownian motions that typically appear are witnesses
 to this fact, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

dominating randomness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 does not depend linearly on 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 in this case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A slight modification of the process above turns it into an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

argmax
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

-process: 
\begin_inset Formula $-f(\theta_{0})(\theta-\theta_{0})^{2}+n^{-\frac{1}{2}}(\theta-\theta_{0})Z$
\end_inset

.
 This is a special case of the more general type of expression 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{n}(\theta)=-c_{1}(\theta-\theta_{0})^{2}+c_{2}n^{-\frac{1}{2}}(\theta-\theta_{0})Z_{\theta}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}>0,c_{2}$
\end_inset

 are constants and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 is an asymptotically normally distributed variable which might depend on
 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $t=(\theta-\theta_{0})$
\end_inset

 to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{n}$
\end_inset

, it has to strike a balance between the negative contribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}t^{2}$
\end_inset

 and the positive contribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{2}n^{-\frac{1}{2}}(\theta-\theta_{0})Z_{\theta}$
\end_inset

.
 When is this likely to happen? If 
\begin_inset Formula $|\theta-\theta_{0}|$
\end_inset

 gets too large, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

 will make the value too small; if 
\begin_inset Formula $|\theta-\theta_{0}|$
\end_inset

 is too small, there will not be enough positive contribution from

When

, the contribution of each side equalises: 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{n}(tn^{-\frac{1}{2}})=n^{-1}\left(c_{1}t^{2}-c_{2}tZ_{tn^{-\frac{1}{2}}+\theta_{0}}\right)$
\end_inset

, but any other choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-\alpha}$
\end_inset

 will put too much weight on either side.
 We will see this rate intuition at work for cube root asymptotics soon.

 The interpretation is simple: For each

\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 is the 
\emph on
actual deviation
\emph default
, as seen from the true 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, while 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}Y_{n}$
\end_inset

 represents the 
\emph on
random deviation
\emph default
.
 We can approximate 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 by a second order Taylor expansion: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & P\left[x-\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x+\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right]-P\left[x_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right]\\
 & = & [F(x+\frac{1}{2}\alpha)-F(x_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha)]-[F(x-\frac{1}{2}\alpha)-F(x_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\alpha)]\\
 & \approx & -\frac{1}{2}(f'(x_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\alpha)-f'(x_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha))(x-x_{0}){}^{2},
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where we use that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x_{0}+a)-f(x_{0}-a)=0$
\end_inset

, which makes the first order terms cancel.
 Now we consider 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n^{\frac{1}{2}}Y_{n}=n\left(P_{n}-P\right)\left[x-\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x+\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right]-n\left(P_{n}-P\right)\left[x_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right].
\]

\end_inset

This process can be rewritten in two ways, depending on whether 
\begin_inset Formula $x\leq x_{0}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $x>x_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $x\leq x_{0}$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n^{\frac{1}{2}}Y_{n}\left(x\right)=n\left(P_{n}-P\right)\left[x+\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right]-n\left(P_{n}-P\right)\left[x-\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right],
\]

\end_inset

and if 
\begin_inset Formula $x>x_{0}$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
n^{\frac{1}{2}}Y_{n}\left(x\right) & = & n\left(P_{n}-P\right)\left[x_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x+\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right]-n\left(P_{n}-P\right)\left[x_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x-\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right].
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

We assume 
\begin_inset Formula $x>x_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x\approx x_{0}$
\end_inset

 from now on, and put 
\begin_inset Formula $t=(x-x_{0})$
\end_inset

.
 This process counts the deviation from expectation in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[x_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x+\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right]$
\end_inset

 and subtracts the deviation from expectation in the disjoint interval 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[x_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right]$
\end_inset

.
 These counts are approximately independent, and if we increase 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 a little bit, there is an equal probability of adding one as subtracting
 one, provided the distribution is approximately symmetric close to the
 mode.
 The expected value of each interval is 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 while each of their variances are approximately 
\begin_inset Formula $n(x-x_{0})f(x_{0}+a)=n(x-x_{0})f(x_{0}-a)$
\end_inset

 by a first order Taylor expansion:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\textrm{Var}n^{\frac{1}{2}}Y_{n}\left(t+x_{0}\right) & = & \textrm{Var}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(1_{\left[x_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x+\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right]}(X_{i})-1_{\left[x_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x-\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right]}(X_{i})\right)\right]\nonumber \\
 & = & P\left[x_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x+\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right]+P\left[x_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\alpha,x-\frac{1}{2}\alpha\right]\nonumber \\
 & \approx & 2ntf(x_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\alpha),\label{eq:First order terms won't cancel}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Thus the process 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{n}$
\end_inset

 looks like it tends to a two-sided Brownian motion with variance 
\begin_inset Formula $2f(x_{0}+\frac{1}{2}\alpha)=2f(x_{0}-\frac{1}{2}\alpha)$
\end_inset

 per unit 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 From this we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{n}\approx n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\sqrt{2f\left(x_{0}+a\right)}W(t)-\frac{1}{2}Vt^{2}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $V=f'(x_{0}-a)-f'(x_{0}+a)$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{x}\approx\argmax_{t}Z_{n}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $W\left(t\right)$
\end_inset

 is a standard two-sided Brownian motion starting in 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 Using the trick in the previous proposition we obtain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c=n^{-\frac{1}{3}}\left(\frac{8f\left(x_{0}+a\right)}{V^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}.
\]

\end_inset

It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\frac{1}{3}}(\widehat{x}-x_{0})\tod\tau^{\frac{1}{3}}Z$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=\frac{8f\left(x_{0}+a\right)}{V^{2}}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Comparing this work to that of the median, there are two important differences.
 First, there is no unique source of randomness across all 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

s, instead we must take the maximum over a Brownian motion with parabolic
 drift.
 Second, the argument for 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}$
\end_inset

 rate doesn't fall through.
 This is because the standard deviation of the random part 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-\frac{1}{2}}\sqrt{2f\left(x_{0}+a\right)}W(y)$
\end_inset

 is of too small order, only 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\theta-\theta_{0}}$
\end_inset

.
 More generally, assume the limit process has the form 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}(\theta-\theta_{0})^{2}+n^{-\frac{1}{2}}c_{2}\sqrt{\theta-\theta_{0}}Z_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 for some constants 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}<0,c_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In order to carry through the equalisation mentioned below Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "thm:median theorem"

\end_inset

 on the median, 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta-\theta_{0}=tn^{-\frac{1}{3}}$
\end_inset

 must be chosen.
 From this we get 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{n}(tn^{-\frac{1}{3}})\approx n^{-\frac{2}{3}}(c_{1}t^{2}+c_{2}\sqrt{t}Z_{\theta}).$
\end_inset

 This is the intuition behind cube root asymptotics offered by Kim & Pollard

 It happens when the first order terms of the variance in the random deviation

Consistency

\begin_layout Standard
In the Donsker and Glivenko-Cantelli results, we were concerned with uniform
 convergence over the whole space: E.g.,

\end_inset

 concerns the uniform convergence over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 In our case, we're not interested in uniform convergence per se, only the
 continuity of the argmax functional: When 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{n}\to M$
\end_inset

 uniformly, it seems intuitively clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\argmax M_{n}\tod\argmax M$
\end_inset

, but we only require that 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{n}\to M$
\end_inset

 uniformly on compacta.
 In our applications, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{n}(\theta)=P_{n}m_{\theta}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $M(\theta)=Pm_{\theta}$

 Notice that the condition is satisfied on compact neighbourhoods of

 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $M$

\begin_inset Formula $\sup_{K\cap d(\theta,\theta_{0})\geq\epsilon}M(\theta)=\max_{K\cap d(\theta,\theta_{0})\geq\epsilon}M(\theta)<M(\theta_{0})$

Consider the ordinary linear regression model 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Y=X^{T}\beta+\epsilon,\;\epsilon\sim N(0,\sigma^{2}),

 The maximum likelihood estimate of this model is given by the ordinary
 least squares (OLS) solution, namely 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\argmin_{\beta}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i}^{T}\beta-Y_{i})^{2}.

\end_inset

While this estimator is efficient under model conditions with no contaminated

 Notice the sum involved in the least squares solution: We minimise the
 mean of the squared residuals 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{i}^{2}=(X_{i}^{T}\beta-Y_{i})^{2}$

 It is well known that the median is far more robust than the mean as an

 a breakdown point of 
\begin_inset Formula $50\%$

 Similarly to the median, it has a breakdown point of

 affected by it (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 This is clearly the upper bound for any reasonable estimator.

 implies that the estimator is independent of the choice of coordinate system,
 which is clearly desirable.
 Scale invariance also appears important to have.
 The regression equivariance doesn't look as intuitively desirable.
 To explain what's going on, take a look at the

 Regression equivariant estimators have the property that one can assume,

There are reasonable, highly robust estimators without some of these properties.
 An example is the repeated median estimator of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, another estimator with 
\begin_inset Formula $50\%$
\end_inset

 breakdown point.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 be the covariate dimension and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ (x_{i},y_{i})\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}\mid i=1,...,n\right\} $
\end_inset

 be observed data.
 For any selection of 
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$

\begin_inset Formula $i_{1},i_{2}...,i_{d+1}$
\end_inset

 between 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

\begin_inset Formula $(1,x_{i_{1}},x_{i_{2}},...,x_{i_{d}})^{T}\beta=(y_{i_{1}},y_{i_{2}},...,y_{i_{d}})^{T}$
\end_inset

 has a unique solution.
 This follows from the ubiquitous full rank condition on the covariates.
 Denote this solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta(i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{d})$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{j}(i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{d})$
\end_inset

 be its 
\begin_inset Formula $j$

 Define the repeated median as follows:

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\beta}_{j}=\textrm{med}_{i_{1}}(\textrm{med}_{i_{2}}(....\textrm{med}_{i_{d}}(\{\beta_{j}(i_{1},i_{2},...,i_{d})\}))...)
\]

\end_inset

When 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1$
\end_inset

, a pair of tuples 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{j},y_{j})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{i},y_{i})$

 yield the parameter estimates
\end_layout

\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The desired estimates is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

This estimator is not affine equivariant.
 It is not a very efficient estimator at standard normal error conditions,
 with efficiency at 
\begin_inset Formula $4/\pi^{2}\approx40.5\%$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "hossjer1994asymptotics"

\end_inset

.
 (Though it compares nicely to the LMS, with an efficiency of 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

!) A related estimator is the Theil-Sen estimator, where the median isn't
 repeated.
 In dimension two, the slope estimate is 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{med}\left\{ \frac{y_{j}-y_{i}}{x_{j}-x_{i}}\mid i<j\right\} $
\end_inset

 and the intercept estimate is 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{med}\left\{ \frac{x_{j}y_{i}-x_{i}y_{j}}{x_{j}-x_{i}}\mid i<j\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 It is more efficient (
\begin_inset Formula $90.5\%)$
\end_inset

 than the repeated median estimator, but has a lower breakdown point at
 
\begin_inset Formula $29\%$
\end_inset

, (ibid.).
 The Theil-Sen estimator isn't affine equivariant either.
 The gist of the matter, for both estimators, is that the estimator runs
 independently on each coordinate, but the runs must be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

coordinated
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in order to make the

The LMS estimator also has the

property: Whenever

 observations lie on a straight line 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{T}x$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\beta}=\theta$

 This property is not shared by e.g.
 OLS regression, but it is not clear whether its desirable in the first

 This property is a straight forward consequence of the geometrical interpretati

 The geometry is arguably easier to understand than OLS geometry.

\begin_layout Standard
If there are no covariates, the regression model reduces to a location model
 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=\theta+\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 In this special case, it is easy to describe its LMS estimator.
 Now the objective function reduces to 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\theta)=\textrm{med}(|y_{i}-\theta|)$
\end_inset

.
 The next proposition was first observed 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "steele1986algorithms"

\end_inset

 in a more general.
 This particular proof is a simplification of theirs to 
\begin_inset Formula $d=2$
\end_inset

.
 In it we use the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

high median
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 convention: When faced with an even number of observations, 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2k$
\end_inset

, we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{med}\{x_{i}\}=x_{(k)}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
The LMS estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=\theta+\epsilon$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{med}(\epsilon)=0$
\end_inset

, is given by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{\theta}=\min_{A\in\mathcal{A}}\frac{1}{2}(\max A+\min A),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{A}=\left\{ S\subset\{y_{1},...,y_{2}\}\mid\#S=\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor+1\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 In addition, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(\widehat{\theta})=\min_{A\in\mathcal{A}}\left(\max A-\min A\right).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We first show that the local minima of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\theta)$
\end_inset

 is on the form 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(\max A-\min A\right)_{A\in\mathcal{A}}.
\]

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 be arbitrary, and assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\theta)$
\end_inset

 is on the form above.
 The value of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\theta)$
\end_inset

 is obtained by taking the 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor+1)$
\end_inset

st element of the list 
\begin_inset Formula $\{|y_{i}-\theta|:i=1,...,n\}$
\end_inset

, hence a slight tilt of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 to the left will make the distance to the rightmost element slightly larger,
 increasing the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\theta)$
\end_inset

; the same argument works for a tilt to the right, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\theta)$
\end_inset

 is a local minimum.
 Conversely, let 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 be the 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor+1)$
\end_inset

-element head of 
\begin_inset Formula $\{|y_{i}-\theta|:i=1,...,n\}$
\end_inset

 associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 and assume 
\begin_inset Formula $|\max A-\theta|>|\min A-\theta|$
\end_inset

.
 If we slide 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 towards the right, we will reach a point 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta'$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $|\max A-\theta'|=|\min A-\theta'|$
\end_inset

.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $|\max A-\theta'|<|\max A-\theta|$
\end_inset

, showing that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\theta)$
\end_inset

 is not a local minimum.

 This estimator is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor+1}\sum_{y\in A}y$
\end_inset

, the mean of the shortest interval containing half of the observations.
 The computation of these estimators is simple: We order the observations,
 then check the distances 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i+\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor+1}-x_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$
\end_inset

, and finally compute the midrange (mean) in order to get the LMS estimate
 (shorth estimate).
 Together this takes 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n\log n)$
\end_inset

 time.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

weirdness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of this explicit solution form casts doubt on whether the LMS is such a
 good idea after all.
 Consider the following example, inspired by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, which shows that the LMS behaves unpredictably when presented with slightly
 manipulated data.
 They called this phenomenon 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

local instability
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $y=(1,3,4,6.0001,10)$
\end_inset

 be the set observations.
 The 3-ary set attaining the smallest midrange is 
\begin_inset Formula $(1,3,4)$
\end_inset

, with midrange 
\begin_inset Formula $2.5$
\end_inset

.
 Assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $y'=(1,3,4,5.999,10)$
\end_inset

 is observed instead.
 The 3-ary set attaining the smallest midrange has changed into 
\begin_inset Formula $(3,4,5.999)$
\end_inset

, with a midrange approximately equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $4.5$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, the same criticism applies to the shorth estimator.

 As the authors say on p.
 229,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Many diagnostics are based on the residuals resulting from LS.
 However, this starting point may lead to useless results because of the
 following reason.
 By definition, LS tries to avoid large residuals.
 Consequently, one outlying case may cause a poor fit for the majority of
 the data because the LS estimator tries to accommodate this case at the
 expense of the remaining observations.
 Therefore, an outlier may have a small LS residual, especially when it
 is a leverage point [...].
 As a consequence, diagnostics based on LS residuals often fail to reveal
 such points.

 Whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is unknown, it is of interest to approximate

s distribution in order to construct confidence intervals, perform hypothesis
 tests, etc.
 A sensible approach is to approximate 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 with a known distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{n}$
\end_inset

, usually (if not always) data dependent, and calculate the distribution
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{n}(\widehat{X}_{1},\ldots,\widehat{X}_{n};Q_{n})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{X}_{1},\ldots,\widehat{X}_{n}\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim}Q_{n}$

 through Monte Carlo methods.

 Still, the smoothed bootstrap hasn't received that much attention.
 In recent years, there has been done some work on the smoothed bootstrap

 This research is motivated by the fact that the ordinary bootstrap isn't
 consistent in general in cube root asymptotics.

 Our goal is to estimate

 Since the bootstrap attempts to approximate a unique distribution conditionally

 conditionally on 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1},X_{2},...\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim}P$

-asymptotics, the maximum of the uniform distribution.
 The nonparametric bootstrap is inconsistent for the maximum in a uniform
 distribution, which we now show.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
(From 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset Formula $X_{1},...,X_{n}\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim}\mathcal{U}(0,\theta)$
\end_inset

, and denote the order statistics 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{(1)}<X_{(2)}<...<X_{(n)}$
\end_inset

.
 We wish to estimate the 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 by its MLE, 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\theta}_{n}=X_{(n)}$
\end_inset

.
 It is well known that 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{n}(P)=n\frac{\theta-X_{(n)}}{\theta}\stackrel{d}{\to}\exp(1)$
\end_inset

, and we take this as our root, with bootstrap variant 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{n}(P_{n})=n\frac{X_{(n)}-X_{(n)}^{*}}{X_{(n)}}.$
\end_inset

 First we find the unconditional distribution.
 Recall the distribution for the maximum of a sample 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{1},...Z_{n}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $P(Z_{(n)}\leq x)=P(Z_{1}\le x,Z_{2}\leq x,...,Z_{n}\leq x)=P(Z_{1}\leq x)^{n}$
\end_inset

, which we can use to find
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(X_{(n)}^{*}=X_{(n-i)}) & = & P(X_{(n)}^{*}\leq X_{(n-i)})-P(X_{(n)}^{*}<X_{(n-i)})\\
 & = & (1-\frac{i}{n})^{n}-(1-\frac{i+1}{n})^{n}\\
 & \approx & e^{-i}-e^{-(i+1)}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Also, it is assumed known that 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

 standard exponentials.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{n}^{*}$
\end_inset

 converges unconditionally to the mixture 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\xi_{i}U_{i}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

 is an infinite multinomial vector with cell probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}=e^{-i}-e^{-(i+1)}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Conditioning on 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1},...,X_{n}$
\end_inset

, we get 
\begin_inset Formula $R_{n}(P_{n})=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\pi_{i}n\frac{X_{(n)}-X_{(n-i)}}{X_{(n)}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a multinomial vector with cell probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\frac{i}{n})^{n}-(1-\frac{i+1}{n})^{n}$
\end_inset

 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\frac{i-1}{n})^{n}-(1-\frac{i}{n})^{n}\nearrow1-e^{-1}\approx0.632$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $i=0$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{(n)}-X_{(n-0)}=0$
\end_inset

, the bootstrap distribution will always have a point mass at 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, sharply discordant with our wish for consistency.
 In fact, it has no limit distribution with probability 1, as both 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\limsup_{n\to\infty}n\frac{X_{(n)}-X_{(n-i)}}{X_{(n)}}=\infty)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\liminf_{n\to\infty}n\frac{X_{(n)}-X_{(n-i)}}{X_{(n)}}=0)=1$

 & = & 1-(1-\frac{x}{n})^{n},\\
 & \to & 1-e^{-x}.

As we can see, not only is the parametric bootstrap consistent, but we have
 the identity

\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Since the rate of convergence is

 we have

\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{n}$
\end_inset

 be the event that 
\begin_inset Formula $|b^{\alpha}(\widehat{\theta}_{n}-\theta_{0})|<\epsilon$

 Then we obtain the following,

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
U_{n}(x-\epsilon)1_{E_{n}}\leq L_{n}(x)1_{E_{n}}\leq U_{n}(x+\epsilon).

\end_inset

If 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{n}(x)\stackrel{p}{\to}H(x)$

\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{n}(x)\stackrel{p}{\to}H(x)$
\end_inset

 as well, hence it suffices to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{n}(x)\stackrel{p}{\to}H(x)$
\end_inset

 Clearly 
\begin_inset Formula $E(U_{n}(x))=H_{n}(x)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Var}U_{n}(x)\to0$
\end_inset

 Since the order of the observations

Overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A linear binary response model
\emph on
 
\emph default
is a regression model 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=1_{X_{i}^{T}\beta+\epsilon_{i}\geq0}$
\end_inset

, where the 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

s are covariates and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

s are random variables not necessarily independent of the 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

s, but independent of each other.
 Several parametric binary choice models exists, of which the most famous
 are the logit and probit models.
 The logit model arises from taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

 i.i.d.
 standard logistic (
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)=\frac{\exp(x)}{1+\exp(x)}$
\end_inset

), while the probit model arises from taking 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

 i.i.d.
 standard normal.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Fact
The logit and probit models are the binary choice models where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{i}\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim}\textrm{Logistic}(0,1)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{i}\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim}N(0,1)$
\end_inset

 respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{i}\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim}\textrm{Logistic}(0,1)$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 be its cdf.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=1$
\end_inset

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}^{T}\beta\geq-\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

, which since 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is symmetric has probability 
\begin_inset Formula $F(X_{i}^{T}\beta)$
\end_inset

.
 The same argument works for the probit model.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While these two methods are very popular (389,000 results on Google Scholar

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

\end_inset

), they have rather strict distributional assumptions.
 Most importantly, they exclude heteroskedasticity and react poorly to non-symme
tric error distributions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will consider a conditional median variant of the binary response model.
 This problem can be viewed as an instance of quantile regression with missing
 data.
 Let the underlying model be 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{i}=X_{i}^{T}\beta+\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

, where the conditional median is required to be 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{med}(\epsilon_{i}|X_{i})=0$
\end_inset

.
 We don't assume independence of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

s, but we observe only the tuple 
\begin_inset Formula $(1_{[W_{i}\geq0]},X_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 Hence there is a tremendous information loss involved in this model, an
 information loss so severe that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

Notice that the estimator maximises the number of correct predictions, which
 makes it unusually easy to interpret.
 The function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

 Colour the points where

\end_inset

 red, and the other points blue, and classify every point in the hyperplane
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x\mid x{}^{T}\beta\geq0\}$
\end_inset

 as red, the others as blue.
 Then Manski's estimator finds the half-planes which classifies correctly
 the largest number of observed points.
 In Figure

For identifiability, we can postulate

 is the Euclidean distance.
 Such a move is required as we have not imposed any scale on the residuals

 Another variant is to impose 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=-1$

\begin_layout Standard
If the assumptions of the probit model or logit model are close to being
 true, to use this estimator would be a very bad idea.
 Not only is it very inefficient, its limiting distribution is intractable,
 and requires resampling.
 But this resampling creates a huge computational burden, and behaves poorly
 when it comes to coverage and size of confidence intervals, etc.
 Additionally, the theory for the logit and probit is very well worked out,
 and its standard asymptotics under maximum likelihood makes it possible
 to use a wealth of different procedures for model selection.
 For instance the likelihood ratio test, AIC, BIC and FIC

.
 Also, Manski's estimator gives information about the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

s only.
 If we want to calculate functionals involving the error term 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 in some way, like estimating the probability on whether a subject with
 covariates 
\begin_inset Formula $X'$
\end_inset

 will have 
\begin_inset Formula $Y'\geq0$
\end_inset

, we will require a probability model 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 for the error terms.
 Since we allow for arbitrary heteroskedasticity and general 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wildness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the errors, it is impossible to consistently estimate the probability
 distributions of the errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A slight generalisation of the estimator allows non-zero weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 on the observations,
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\widehat{\beta} & = & \argmax\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}(Y_{i}-\frac{1}{2})1_{\beta^{T}X_{i}\geq0}\right],\label{eq:Manskis estimator (weighted)}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

a variant we will devise an algorithm to solve.
 It is useful to have an algorithm for the weighted variant for practical
 reasons, in particular when performing the bootstrap, as our algorithm
 will not handle observations that aren't in general position: It is easier
 to treat two identical observations as one observation with twice the weight.
 Also, the algorithm is just as fast for the weighted variant as for the
 non-weighted, and not much more difficult to implement.

Recall the equivariance properties from Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 There we defined regression, affine and scale equivariance for regression
 estimators.
 The regression and scale equivariance concepts don't make sense in the
 context of the binary response model, as they involve continuous transformation
s of the responses 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{i}$
\end_inset

 Still, Manski's estimator does satisfy the affine equivariance property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
Manski's estimator is affine equivariant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\beta}=\argmax\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i}-\frac{1}{2})1_{\beta^{T}X_{i}\geq0}\right]$
\end_inset

 be the set of solutions to Manski's objective function.
 The only place 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

 is involved in 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i}-\frac{1}{2})1_{\beta^{T}X_{i}\geq0}$
\end_inset

 is in 
\begin_inset Formula $1_{\beta^{T}X_{i}\geq0}$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, each of these characteristic functions stay the same when substituting
 
\begin_inset Formula $AX_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(A^{-1})^{T}\beta$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, showing that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i}-\frac{1}{2})1_{((A^{-1})^{T}\widehat{b})^{T}AX_{i}\geq0}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i}-\frac{1}{2})1_{\widehat{b}^{T}X_{i}\geq0}$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{b}\in\widehat{\beta}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is invertible, this can be done the other way around as well.
 This proves that 
\begin_inset Formula $(A^{-1})^{T}\widehat{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is the solution set of the transformed 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i}-\frac{1}{2})1_{\beta^{T}AX_{i}\geq0}$

\begin_inset Formula $b\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 We say that the system of linear inequalities 
\begin_inset Formula $Ax\leq b$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
feasible 
\emph default
if there exists a solution to it; if there is no solution, it is called
 
\emph on

\emph default
 These terms have the same meaning whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is a collection of linear inequalities.
 Given an infeasible linear system, it is often of interest to find a maximal
 subsystem which is feasible, that is, a feasible collection 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 of inequalities from 
\begin_inset Formula $Ax\leq b$
\end_inset

 of cardinality 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 such that there exists no feasible collection of cardinality greater than
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 This problem is of importance in linear programming, as the constraints
 in such problems easily can turn out to be inconsistent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
Given a system 
\begin_inset Formula $Ax\leq b$

Now we will show that solution sets for Manski's estimator 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 are exactly the solution sets to a certain MAX-FLS problem.
 For this, define 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i0}=1$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Proposition

-X_{i(j-1)} & \textrm{when }Y_{i}=0.

Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{*}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
In

\end_inset

that are simultaneously satisfied.
 Intuitively, one satisfied inequality corresponds to one correct prediction,
 and we wish to maximise the amount of correct predictions.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta^{*}$

 is an inner solution to such a set of inequalities, we can substitute any
 instance of 
\begin_inset Formula $\leq$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $<$

 Since

 we are done.

.
 This adds more solutions at the boundaries, but doing the bookkeeping on
 whether a certain inequality is strict or not is messy.
 Doing this will not cause any problems in practice.
 If we want to use the spherical scaling 
\begin_inset Formula $||\beta||=1$
\end_inset

, we would intersect the solution set with 
\begin_inset Formula $S^{d}$
\end_inset

.
 If we want to use the more restrictive scaling 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=-1,0,1$
\end_inset

, we will instead use a different matrix (with dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $d\times n$
\end_inset

): Namely 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{*}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{ij}^{*}=\begin{cases}
X_{ij}, & \textrm{when }Y_{i}=1,\\
-X_{ij} & \textrm{when }Y_{i}=0.
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

Notice that we have dropped the intercept.
 Now 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=-1$
\end_inset

 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{*}\beta\leq1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=0$
\end_inset

 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $X^{*}\beta\leq0$

Perhaps the most striking about this characterisation is the fact that solutions
 are never unique, provided the observations are in general position.
 This is problematic for several reasons.
 First, it makes resampling difficult.
 It is not clear which point we will choose as a centre in the bootstrap
 or which points to choose from the resampled solutions.
 This problem is even larger than it looks, because small resampling sizes
 will often give unbounded solution regions, and we will have to use small
 samples in order to make the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$

\begin_layout Standard
The kind of polytopes we are interested in result from the intersection
 of half-planes, and there will necessarily be fewer of them.
 It would be interesting to find an analogue of this theorem for coloured
 hyperplanes, though we would most likely have to be content with upper
 and lower bounds.
 An interesting corollary concerns resampling, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
For any resampling procedure, the maximal amount of distinct possible solution
 sets is bounded above by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{d}\binom{n}{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is in acute contrast with smooth estimators.
 As an example, take the mean of

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,n$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 has a density.
 Then the non-parametric bootstrap has 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{2n-1}{n}$
\end_inset

 distinct solutions, the subsampler has 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{n}{m}$
\end_inset

 and

\end_inset

-out-of-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 has 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{n+m-1}{m}$
\end_inset

 This alone could give an indication of why the bootstrap tends to fail
 for estimators with cube root asymptotics.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For coloured hyperplanes and 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1$
\end_inset

, the upper bound in Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 can be improved to
\begin_inset Formula $\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil$
\end_inset

, which is sharp: Let the first element be red, the second blue, third red,
 etc.
 The lower bound on the number of solution sets is 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, which happens whenever the points are perfectly separated by a line (all
 red points to the left, all blue points to the right).
 This arrangement appears when the variance of

Location depth
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given unidimensional data 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},\ldots,x_{n},$

 we define the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-th order statistic as the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-th element in the sorted list 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{i_{1}},x_{i_{2}},\ldots,x_{i_{n}})$
\end_inset

.
 The rank 
\begin_inset Formula $R(x_{j})$
\end_inset

 of a point 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 is its index in the preceding list.
 In 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyear
key "tukey1975mathematics"

\end_inset

, Tukey considered a slight modification of this concept.
 He defined what is now called the location depth, in one dimension, as
 the minimum of 
\begin_inset Formula $R(x_{j})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n-R(x_{j})+1$
\end_inset

.
 Hence values far to the left and far to the right have small location depths,
 while those in the middle --- deep in the data --- have large location
 depths.
 Furthermore, it is clear that the median has depth 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx\frac{n}{2}$
\end_inset

, the quartiles have depth 
\begin_inset Formula $\approx\frac{n}{4}$
\end_inset

, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going further, this concept was generalised to dimensions bigger than one.
 Here the concept of ranks usually doesn't make sense, as the available
 orders, like the lexicographic ordering, don't correspond to anything of
 interest.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
it is easy to see that this is a generalisation of the unidimensional depth
 described in the first paragraph.
 An equivalent definition of the location depth, used in e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "donoho1992breakdown"

\end_inset

, is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
D(y;A)=\min_{||u||=1}\#\{u^{T}x_{i}\geq u^{T}y\}.
\]

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{T}x$
\end_inset

 is the projection on the direction 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

.
 These definitions are equivalent, as 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x\mid u^{T}x\geq u^{T}y\}$
\end_inset

 defines a half-plane with 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 on the boundary.
 While Tukey was motivated by picturing bidimensional data through drawing
 of location depth contour lines, Donoho and Gasko (ibid.) were interested
 in the robustness properties of the 
\emph on
Tukey median
\emph default
.
 It is defined as the point in 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 which has the highest depth, hence it is a natural generalisation of the
 median to higher dimensions.
 They showed that its breakdown point is bounded below by 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{1+d}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is the dimension of the underlying space.
 The concept of location depth has other applications as well, such as in
 the construction of bootstrap regions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "yeh1997balanced"

\end_inset

.
 It can be used to generalise the empirical cumulative distribution function,
 and also in to generalise 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

-statistics: For instance, the analogue of the 
\emph on
midhinge 
\emph default
(mean of the quartiles) is the mean of all points with depth 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{n}{4}$
\end_inset

; the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

-trimmed mean is the mean of all points with the 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\alpha)\%$
\end_inset

 largest depths.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we show that computing the location depth can be reduced to MAX-FLS.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}\in A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

 be data points and consider finding 
\begin_inset Formula $D(x_{j};A)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}\in A$
\end_inset

.
 Take note of that 
\begin_inset Formula $\min_{||u||=1}\#\{u^{T}x_{i}\geq u^{T}y\}=\max_{||u||=1}\#\{u^{T}(x_{i}-y)<0\}$
\end_inset

.
 For any sequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $i=i_{1},...,i_{k}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{T}(x_{i}-y)<0$
\end_inset

 for every such 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 if and only if the linear inequality system 
\begin_inset Formula $Zu<\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

 is feasible, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{ij}=x_{ij}-y_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{0}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-ary vector of zeros.
 Hence it is an instance of MAX-FLS with strict inequalities.
 One difference between this problem and Manski's estimator is the focus:
 In the Manski setting, we are interested primarily in the solution set
 
\begin_inset Formula $\{u\mid\#\{u^{T}x_{i}<u^{T}y\}=\max_{||u||=1}\#\{u^{T}x_{i}<u^{T}y\}\}$
\end_inset

, while this is not of interest in the location depth setting.
 This has some consequences when it comes to algorithms.
 Since we are interested in knowing about qualitatively different solutions
 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 for Manski's estimator, but not for the location depth, we need not be
 as considerate in finding every possible solution in the latter case.
 This will potentially save time and space.
 Still, this could be part of an explanation why statistics and methods
 based on the location depth aren't more popular, as the NP-completeness
 of the underlying problem guarantees that everything runs slowly.

 This particular estimator deserves to be included here, as it is very similar
 to Manski's estimator in several regards.
 In covariate dimension one, it has similar geometry and interpretation
 as Manski's estimator, and part of the algorithm for its computation, discussed
 in Section 4.4, is almost exactly the same.
 Furthermore, it works under similar conditions, most importantly 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{med}(\epsilon\mid x)=0$

 with arbitrary heteroskedasticity.
 Luckily, this estimator is

\begin_inset Formula $z$

 Now define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{depth}(\alpha;A)$

 as the minimal amount of points to be removed in order to make

 A regression line with large depth could be considered 
\emph on

, in the sense that it is not easy to tilt it far in any direction without
 crossing many observations.
 This concept gives rise to the method of deepest regression.
 A line 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is a deepest regression estimator if it solves 
\begin_inset Formula $\arg\max_{\alpha}\mathrm{depth}(\alpha;A)$
\end_inset

 The resulting estimator is robust, with an asymptotic breakdown point of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{3}$
\end_inset

 Its downsides are computational difficulties, in particular for dimensions
 greater than 2, and an intractable limit distribution.
 Compared to LAD (least absolute deviations) regression, this method is

The following limit distribution is of no practical interest.
 It is very time consuming to calculate it, and it is analytically intractable.
 The exception is with one covariate in the

 setting, where we yet again get a rescaled Chernoff's distribution.

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\argmax_{\beta\in B}\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}(Y_{i}-\frac{1}{2})1_{[X_{i}^{T}\beta\geq0]},\label{eq:Weighted argmax objective}

\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$

 It has already been said that this problem isn't identified --- if 
\begin_inset Formula $a>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is a solution, 
\begin_inset Formula $a\widehat{\beta}$
\end_inset

 is also a solution.
 In order to fix the scales, two approaches are used: 1.) If the intercept
 is believed to be positive, put 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Likewise, if the intercept is believed to be negative, put 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=-1$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, if we believe than 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, the scale will not be fixed, and we will have to use a method like the
 next.
 2.) Add the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $||\beta||=1$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $||\cdot||$
\end_inset

 is the Euclidean norm in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{d}$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, these approaches are not equivalent.
 For the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $||\beta||=1$
\end_inset

 allows for more solutions that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 does, while a solution set with the 
\begin_inset Formula $||\beta||=1$
\end_inset

 constraint (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}>0$
\end_inset

) easily can be transformed into a solution set for the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 condition by dividing the solution by 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Also, if we solve the 
\begin_inset Formula $\argmax$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=0,1,-1$
\end_inset

, we can combine the solution sets separately into a solution set consistent
 with 
\begin_inset Formula $||\beta||=1$
\end_inset

 MAX-FLS.

A decision problem is a function with boolean output.

 is the class of all decision problems computable in polynomial time.
 
\emph on
NP
\emph default
 is the class of all decision problems that are polynomially verifiable.
 That is, given a solution certificate which is polynomial in the size of
 the input, it takes polynomial time to verify it.
 A polynomial time reduction between decision problems 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is a polynomial time program 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 which translates an instance of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 into an instance of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 A problem 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is NP-hard if any 
\begin_inset Formula $B\in NP$
\end_inset

 can be polynomial time reduced to 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 A problem is NP-complete if it is in NP and is NP-hard.

 For more information about computational complexity theory, see e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 The main point of discussing NP-completeness is roughly that NP-complete
 problems can't be solved fast unless 
\begin_inset Formula $P=NP$
\end_inset

.
 It is generally assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $P\neq NP$
\end_inset

, but proving it is considered among the greatest unsolved problems of mathemati
cs.
 As can be seen from the definition, the theory doesn't apply to optimisation
 problems, but only to decision problems.
 When given an maximisation problem with objective function 
\begin_inset Formula $M$

 We use a different approach, namely a reduction of MAX-2-SAT to MAX-FLS.
 We need some definitions.
 Let

 We say that

 A propositional formula

 if there exists an assignment of the variables

 that makes it true, e.g.

 An unsatisfiable formula is a contradiction --- it is always false.

 The corresponding decision problem is: Given a

\begin_layout Proposition
The decision problem MAX-FLS is NP-complete.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We show that MAX 2-SAT can be polynomial-time reduced to MAX-FLS.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 be the number of variables in 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 be its number of clauses.
 Also, define 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ij}$
\end_inset

 as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

sign
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

-th variable in the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th clause: For example, if the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th clause is 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{5}\wedge\neg x_{9})$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i5}=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i9}=-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ij}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $j\neq5,9$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 be the matrix with 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ij}$
\end_inset

 as its 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,j)$
\end_inset

-th element and let 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 be an 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-dimensional vector having only 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 as elements.
 Then there are 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 satisfiable clauses if and only if there is a subsystem 
\begin_inset Formula $A'$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 rows such that 
\begin_inset Formula $A'x\geq\mathbf{1}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{1}$
\end_inset

 is the appropriately sized vector with only ones.
 Now add the constraints 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}=1$
\end_inset

, each 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

 times.
 (These can be implemented as two inequalities of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\leq$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

).
 Then we effectively force the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-vector to be integral by adding an additional 
\begin_inset Formula $4m(n+1)$
\end_inset

 constraints.
 The resulting system is ready to be solved by a MAX-FLS(k) solver, and
 its solution is clearly the same as for MAX-SAT(k).
 Since the input size is polynomial in the input size of MAX 2-SAT, the
 problem is 
\begin_inset Formula $NP$
\end_inset

-hard.
 MAX-FLS(k) is in NP: Given a solution, it can be verified in polynomial
 time simply by checking each inequality.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that, while MAX-FLS is NP-hard, it is only so when the number of
 inequality constraints and variables are considered at the same time.
 Soon we will describe an algorithm which runs in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{d}\log(n))$
\end_inset

 time, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the number of constraints and 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is the number of variables.
 This translates into 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 observations and covariate dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 in our setting, and since we think of the dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 as something constant (or a parameter), the algorithm could well be understood
 as polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 --- which is considered 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fast
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 in this context.
 But outside this specific problem, the amount of variables (that is 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 He proposed to iteratively check the function value on every corner of

 There are 
\begin_inset Formula $\binom{n}{d}\approx(d!)^{-1}n^{d}$
\end_inset

 possible corners to check, and it takes around 
\begin_inset Formula $O(d^{3})$
\end_inset

 time to invert a matrix.
 (This is done in order to obtain the coordinates of the corners.) In addition,
 finding the value of the objective function is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(nd)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{d+1})$

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 A mixed integer program is a linear program where some of the variables
 can be constrained to be integers, and most natural combinatorial optimisation
 problems can be represented as an integer program.
 We present a slightly modified variant of their program, taken from

x_{i}\beta & < & -1+Mz_{i},\textrm{ when }Y_{i}=0,\\
 &  & z_{i}\in\{0,1\},\\
 &  & \beta\in\mathbb{R}^{d}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The constraints run over every 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,n$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is a large constant.
 In order to see that this is the right formulation, take a subset 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i_{1}},z_{i_{2}},...,z_{i_{k}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1},\beta_{2},...$
\end_inset

 which satisfies it.
 An equation of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $-x_{i}\beta\leq1+Mz_{i}$
\end_inset

 will have 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}=1$
\end_inset

 iff 
\begin_inset Formula $-x_{i}\beta\leq1$
\end_inset

 is unsatisfied; the same goes for 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}\beta\leq-1+Mz_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The objective 
\begin_inset Formula $\min\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}z_{i}$
\end_inset

 assures that we include the minimal weighted number of unsatisfied constraints,
 yielding a solution to the maximal problem.
 The role of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is to loosen the constraint so much that they are always satisfied.
 This can be chosen to be 
\begin_inset Formula $Bd\max_{i,j}x_{ij}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is a reasonable upper bound on the absolute value of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$

\begin_inset Formula $\max_{i,j}x_{ij}$

 In this thesis, our attention is restricted to

\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=0$

 In the following we impose the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=1$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $(y_{i},x_{i})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,n$

 be observations from a binary response model with 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1$
\end_inset

 The colour of a point 
\begin_inset Formula $-\frac{1}{x_{i}}$
\end_inset

 is defined by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Definition
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mbox{col}(-\frac{1}{x_{i}})=\begin{cases}
\mathrm{red} & \textrm{when }(x_{i}>0\mbox{ and }y_{i}=1)\textrm{ or }(x_{i}<0\mbox{ and }y_{i}=0),\\
\mathrm{blue} & \textrm{when }(x_{i}<0\mbox{ and }y_{i}=1)\textrm{ or }(x_{i}>0\mbox{ and }y_{i}=0).
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We make use of the function 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{col}$
\end_inset

 any more, but simple call points red or blue depending on which of the
 two conditions is satisfied.
 As for the motivation for this colouring, recall the algebraic characterisation
 of Manski's objective in Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:AlgebraCharacterisation"

\end_inset

.
 When formulated for 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1,$
\end_inset

 we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
-\beta_{1}x_{i}\leq1 & \textrm{when} & Y_{i}=1,\label{eq:One d inequalites}\\
\beta_{1}x_{i}<-1 & \textrm{when} & Y_{i}=0.\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

If 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}>0$
\end_inset

, the these inequalities are equivalent to 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\beta_{1}\geq-\frac{1}{x_{i}} & \textrm{when} & Y_{i}=1,\\
\beta_{1}<-\frac{1}{x_{i}} & \textrm{when} & Y_{i}=0,
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

while 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}<0$
\end_inset

 gives 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\beta_{1}\leq-\frac{1}{x_{i}} & \textrm{when} & Y_{i}=1,\\
\beta_{1}>-\frac{1}{x_{i}} & \textrm{when} & Y_{i}=0.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Accordingly a point is 
\begin_inset Formula $-\frac{1}{x_{i}}$
\end_inset

 is blue when its corresponding equation is satisfied for every 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}<-\frac{1}{x_{i}}$
\end_inset

, and similarly for red points.
 In the following proposition, we denote Manski's objective 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Manski's objective"

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
m(z)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_{i}-\frac{1}{2})1_{1+zx_{i}\geq0}.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
Denote 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}=-\frac{1}{x_{i}}$
\end_inset

, let 
\begin_inset Formula $z\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 and define 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
r_{l}(z) & = & \textrm{number of red points to the left of }z,\\
b_{r}(z) & = & \textrm{number of blue points to the right of }z,
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

both quantities being inclusive.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $m(z)$
\end_inset

 equals 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{l}(z)+b_{r}(z)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The objective function 
\begin_inset Formula $m(z)$
\end_inset

 counts the number of satisfied inequalities in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:One d inequalites"

\end_inset

.
 By the reasoning above, the inequality belonging to a blue point 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is satisfied by 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 iff 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is to the right of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, an inequality belonging to a red point 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{j}$
\end_inset

 is satisfied iff 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{j}$
\end_inset

 is to the left 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 The result follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can use this proposition to identify the solution sets.
 Recall from the geometric characterisation (Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lem:Geometry characterization"

\end_inset

) that the solution sets are maximal disjoint convex polytopes, which in
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 means disjoint intervals.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $[z_{i},z_{j}]$
\end_inset

 is a maximal bounded solution interval, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 must be red and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{j}$
\end_inset

 blue.
 For if 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is blue, either there is red point 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{l}$
\end_inset

 to its left with 
\begin_inset Formula $m(z_{l})=m(z_{i})$
\end_inset

, or there is no point at all, which implies 
\begin_inset Formula $m(z)=m(z_{i})$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $z<z_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This contradicts the maximality of 
\begin_inset Formula $[z_{i},z_{j}]$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition

Assume the list

 is sorted, and also add two non-coloured points 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{0}=-\infty$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{n+1}=\infty$
\end_inset

 A solution interval is of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $[z_{i},z_{i+1}]$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is either red or 
\begin_inset Formula $-\infty$

\begin_inset Formula $z_{i+1}$
\end_inset

 is either blue or 
\begin_inset Formula $\infty$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
it is impossible to have three adjacent 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i},z_{i+1},z_{i+2}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $m(z_{i})=m(z_{i+1})=m(z_{i+2})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $z_{i+1}$
\end_inset

 is blue, 
\begin_inset Formula $m(z_{i})>m(z_{i+2})$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $m(z_{i})<m(z_{i+2})$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
What happens if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=-1$
\end_inset

 instead? Then all the points swap colours and signs, and the same argument
 applies.
 Now we're ready to describe an algorithm for computing the estimator.
 Essentially we sort the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}=-\frac{1}{x_{i}}$
\end_inset

, find their colour, and sequentially calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{l}(z_{i})+b_{r}(z_{i})$
\end_inset

, starting from the left.
 Using this algorithm, we only have to visit each point twice, because 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
r_{l}(z_{i+1}) & = & r_{l}(z_{i})+1_{col(z_{i+1})=\textrm{red}},\\
b_{r}(z_{i+1}) & = & b_{r}(z_{i})-1_{col(z_{i})=\textrm{blue}},
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

and both 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{l}(z_{1})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{l}(z_{1})$
\end_inset

 can be calculated in by visiting every point one time.
 The output is the list of values 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{l}(z_{i})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{l}(z_{i})$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Proposition
The procedure RedBlue in Algorithm 1 is correct.
 Its asymptotic runtime is 
\begin_inset Formula $\Theta(n\log n$
\end_inset

).
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
This means that the algorithm is both 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n\log n)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega(n\log n$
\end_inset

).
 That is, it is asymptotically bounded both above and below by 
\begin_inset Formula $n\log n$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
As the algorithm is correct by the preceding discussion, we will calculate
 the runtime.
 As for the runtime, it is well known that sorting is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n\log n)$
\end_inset

 .
 The amount of arithmetic operations done is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

 for the first element and 
\begin_inset Formula $4$
\end_inset

 for each of the other elements.
 Therefore the algorithm is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n\log n)+O(n)=O(n\log n$
\end_inset

).
 As for the lower bound, it is also known that comparison-based sort has
 the asymptotic lower bound 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega(n\log n)$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 58"
key "dasgupta2006algorithms"

\end_inset

.
 Knowing the solution to this problem one can clearly find the sorted list
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n\log n)$
\end_inset

 operations, by sorting on the 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{l}(z_{i})$
\end_inset

, and then the 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{r}(z_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 From this we arrive at the lower bound.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Clearly, the algorithm can easily be extended to work for the weighted 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 as well.
 If we maximise for both 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=-1$
\end_inset

 simultaneously, this algorithm is the same as the algorithm 
\begin_inset Formula $rdepth$
\end_inset

 for the calculation of the regression depth in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, except they are minimising instead of maximising.
 To maximise for 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{0}=-1$
\end_inset

, we'd substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{l}(z)$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{r}(z)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{r}(z)$

If we are only interested in finding one solution, not the entire solution
 set, it might be possible to improve the runtime of this algorithm by using
 an approach similar to that of the Quickselect algorithm: The reason why
 our algorithm isn't linear time is because we presort the entire list,
 something which is not necessary when we only need one maximum.
 By using the concept of colour depth from Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "sec:Manski Robustness"

\end_inset

, one can attempt to create a sophisticated branch-and-bound algorithm in
 order to prune the computation tree of QuickSort.
 It is unknown whether such an idea would work out or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\begin_layout Standard
An approach to solving this problem is to iteratively apply the RedBlue
 algorithm: For each half-plane 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{i}$
\end_inset

 with boundary 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}$
\end_inset

, we can calculate the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $m(\beta_{1},\beta_{2})$
\end_inset

 (Manski's objective, 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Manski's objective"

\end_inset

) for every 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1},\beta_{2}\in L_{i}$
\end_inset

 by using the RedBlue algorithm.
 This is done by calculating the intersection point 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{j}=L_{i}\cap L_{j}$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $j\neq i$
\end_inset

, and decide on whether 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is blue or red.
 We walk along 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}$
\end_inset

 from right to left.
 When we encounter another line 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{j}$
\end_inset

, we observe whether the half-plane 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{i}$
\end_inset

 covers the ground we've already passed or not, if it is covered, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is coloured red; if it doesn't, it is coloured blue.
 Be aware that

\end_inset

, where the colour of hyperplanes are defined as in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It depends on the relation between the slopes of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{j}$
\end_inset

 in addition to the colour, as illustrated in the figure.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

 be the slope of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{j}$
\end_inset

 be the slope of

 If

 be coloured oppositely of 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{i}$

\end_inset

.
 The maxima of all these will come in pairs corresponding to intervals on
 some 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{i}$
\end_inset

, hence they will form line segments.
 These line segments will, by the geometric characterisation, form convex
 polygons in the plane, and the solution set is the union of these polygons.
 Running through the procedure, we visit 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 lines and check 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

 intersections for each of them.
 Since RedBlue runs in

We can recursively apply the same idea in covariate dimensions

 Assuming we can solve MAX-FLS in

\begin_inset Formula $1+X_{i}^{T}\beta$

\begin_inset Formula $(d-1)$
\end_inset

-dimensional facets there.
 As an example, consider 
\begin_inset Formula $d=3$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, the solution sets are polyhedra.
 In order to find the 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

-maximal polyhedra, we identify the 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

-maximal faces.
 For a single plane 
\begin_inset Formula $1+X_{i}^{T}\beta$
\end_inset

, we cam find its optimal faces by running the 2-dimensional algorithm on
 the arrangement arising from 
\begin_inset Formula $1+X_{i}^{T}\beta$
\end_inset

 intersected with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1+X_{j}^{T}\beta\right\} _{j\neq i}$
\end_inset

.
 If we do this for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i,$
\end_inset

 we will uncover the maximal faces, from which we can construct the maximal
 polytopes.
 This procedure is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{3}\log n)$
\end_inset

, as it runs through 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 different 2-dimensional algorithms with run-time 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{2}\log n)$

 This can clearly be generalised to arbitrary dimensions, yielding the general
 run time 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{d}\log n)$

 Define

\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, respectively.
 All of this is inclusive.
 We define the colour depth of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{C}(z)=\min\left\{ r_{l}(z)-b_{l}(z),b_{r}(z)-r_{r}(z)\right\} $

 Also let

 be the

 If

\begin_inset Formula $z$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following lemma indicates why this is an important concept: To maximise
 the colour depth is equivalent to the maximisation of Manski's objective
 function 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

, which we denote 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Lemma
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "lem:Maximality Condition, d = 1"

\end_inset

A point 
\begin_inset Formula $z\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is a solution to Manski's objective if and only if it is of maximal colour
 depth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is of non-maximal colour depth, and assume wlog there is a point 
\begin_inset Formula $z'$
\end_inset

 of greater colour depth to its right.
 Now count of blue 
\begin_inset Formula $(b)$
\end_inset

 and red 
\begin_inset Formula $(r)$
\end_inset

 points between 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z'$
\end_inset

.
 We have three cases: If 
\begin_inset Formula $r>b$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $m(z)=b_{r}(z)+r_{l}(z)=b+b_{r}(z')+r_{l}(z)<r+b_{r}(z')+r_{l}(z)=m(z')$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $r=b$
\end_inset

, both 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{l}(z')-b_{l}(z')=r_{l}(z)-b_{l}(z)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{r}(z')-r_{r}(z')=b_{r}(z)-r_{r}(z)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z'$
\end_inset

 hasn't greater colour depth than 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 Lastly, if 
\begin_inset Formula $r<b$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{l}(z')-b_{l}(z')<r_{l}(z)-b_{l}(z)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{r}(z')-r_{r}(z')<b_{r}(z)-r_{r}(z)$
\end_inset

, again contradicting that 
\begin_inset Formula $z'$
\end_inset

 has greater colour depth.
 From this both claims follows: The first implication 
\begin_inset Formula $(\Rightarrow)$
\end_inset

 is proved contrapositively, while the second 
\begin_inset Formula $(\Leftarrow)$
\end_inset

 by assuming another point is maximal and reaching a contradiction.
  
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to make the estimator break down, we will have to add and remove
 strategically chosen lines such that 1.) every point 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 of maximal colour depth loses that status and 2.) there is a new set of
 points with maximal colour depth placed arbitrarily far out.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "lem:Finite sample breakdown, d = 1"

\end_inset

The finite sample breakdown point of Manski's estimator with 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\lceil\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rceil/n$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We begin with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon^{*}\leq\lceil\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rceil/n$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 have maximal colour depth, and assume wlog the minimal weight is on its
 right.
 In that case, there are 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}$
\end_inset

 surplus blues on its right.
 Now change the colour of these 
\begin_inset Formula $\lceil\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rceil$
\end_inset

 points, starting from the rightmost one.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $z'$
\end_inset

 be the rightmost of the red points, with 
\begin_inset Formula $m(z')=r_{l}(z)+r_{r}(z)+\lceil\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rceil$
\end_inset

.
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula $m(z)=r_{l}(z)+b_{r}(z)-\lceil\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rceil$
\end_inset

.
 But since 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{r}(z)+\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}=b_{r}(z)-\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}$
\end_inset

 by definition, the rightmost point is a solution and we have attained a
 breakdown.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Now assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon^{*}<\lceil\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rceil/n$
\end_inset

, and let the points be reconfigured such that a breakdown has been attained
 in less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\lceil\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rceil$
\end_inset

 steps.
 Without loss of generality, assume that the rightmost element of the new
 configuration is red.
 Since this point is a solution, it has maximal colour depth.
 Furthermore, the maximal colour depth is equal to zero, as there are 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 points to the right of it.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 be any other point, which automatically satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{C}(z)\leq0$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 is a witness to the the maximal colour depth of the original configuration,
 we must be able to recover this number by replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $\lceil\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rceil$
\end_inset

 points.
 Since an element can increase its maximal colour depth with at most two
 for each rearrangement of a single point, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{C}(z)<2\lceil\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rceil$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}$
\end_inset

 is even, this is contrary to hypothesis.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}$
\end_inset

 is odd, notice that since 
\begin_inset Formula $\lfloor\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rfloor=\lceil\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rceil+1$
\end_inset

, we would have to be able to recover 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{C}(z)$
\end_inset

 in at least 
\begin_inset Formula $2\lfloor\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rfloor$
\end_inset

.
 But this gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{C}(z)\leq2\lfloor\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rfloor<\mathfrak{M}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A special case occurs when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}=0,$
\end_inset

 which gives a breakdown point of 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 This is not an error.
 When the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, the solution set is unbounded either to the right or to the left, hence
 it has already broke down.
 To see why, assume we have a configuration which has 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M=}0$
\end_inset

.
 Choice a maximal point 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 and assume its minimal colour depth occurs to its right.
 Clearly, there are equally many, say 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, blues and reds on that side.
 If the rightmost point is red, the solution set is unbounded, so assume
 it is not.
 If the rightmost point is blue, choose the red point closest to it, named
 
\begin_inset Formula $z'$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $m(z')\geq r_{l}(z)+k+1$
\end_inset

, as it covers all the red points 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 covers, all the red points to its right and at least one blue point.
 But this contradicts the maximality of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, as 
\begin_inset Formula $m(z)=r_{l}(z)+k$
\end_inset

.
 This happens with non-zero probability in familiar settings when 
\begin_inset Formula $n=100$
\end_inset

, as we can see in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:Simulated-breakdown-points"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
Since solutions aren't unique, it is not entirely clear how to define the
 breakdown point.
 Two different choices can be made.
 We can think of the estimator as broken down whenever there is a solution
 with unbounded absolute value, which is our choice here.
 On the other hand, we could also think of the estimator as broken when
 there are no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

small
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 solutions at all: If for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n\in\mathbb{N}$
\end_inset

 there are some points such that the absolute value of the new configuration's
 minimal solution is greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 In order to make the second definition work, the breakdown point would
 be 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lfloor\frac{\mathfrak{M}}{2}\rfloor+1)/n$
\end_inset

 instead.
 We will use the first definition as it makes proofs slightly easier: When
 replacing points, we will only have to think about switching colours, not
 changing coordinates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 we get the following rough upper bound on the asymptotic breakdown point.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset CommandInset label

The breakdown point of Manski's estimator with 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\nicefrac{1}{4}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The best possible value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $n/2$
\end_inset

, which is attained iff the points are perfectly separated into a set of
 red elements only on the left and a set blue elements on the right.
 Pass 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 to the limit in order to get the result.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given covariates 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}\sim G$
\end_inset

 and an error distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

, we can calculate the asymptotic analogues of 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{l}(\widehat{\beta}),b_{r}(\widehat{\beta})$
\end_inset

 etc.
 through substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\beta}$
\end_inset

 and then calculating their exact distributions.
 If we denote the exact distributions 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{l}^{\infty}(\beta),b_{r}^{\infty}(\beta)$
\end_inset

 etc., we see that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
r_{l}^{\infty}(\beta) & = & P(Y=0,X<0,-\frac{1}{X}<\beta)+P(Y=1,X\geq0,-\frac{1}{X}<\beta),\\
b_{l}^{\infty}(\beta) & = & P(Y=1,X<0,-\frac{1}{X}<\beta)+P(Y=0,X\geq0,-\frac{1}{X}<\beta),\\
b_{r}^{\infty}(\beta) & = & P(Y=1,X<0,-\frac{1}{X}>\beta)+P(Y=0,X\geq0,-\frac{1}{X}>\beta),\\
r_{r}^{\infty}(\beta) & = & P(Y=0,X<0,-\frac{1}{X}>\beta)+P(Y=1,X\geq0,-\frac{1}{X}>\beta).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

These equations follow directly from the definitions of blue and red points.
 As corollary of this observation and the preceding proposition, we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
The breakdown point of Manski's estimator (
\begin_inset Formula $d=1$

) is
\end_layout

\]

\end_inset

 This comes as no surprise; the exponential distribution has a median of

 at minimum, a value it is difficult to overcome for

.
 The concept is deeper and more difficult to analyse.
 The following is a natural generalisation of Lemma 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lem:Maximality Condition, d = 1"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Conjecture
A point has 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is of maximal colour depth iff it is a solution to Manski's objective.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 points, which configuration of coloured planes would give the highest breakdown
 point? It appears likely that this is a 
\emph on
d-simplex
\emph default
 where each face has 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{n}{d+1}$
\end_inset

 planes of the same colour stacked on the top of one another.
 A 
\begin_inset Formula $d-$
\end_inset

simplex is 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

-polytope with the smallest possible number of faces, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $d+1$
\end_inset

.
 Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $n=(d+1)k$
\end_inset

 for a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, and observe that the maximal colour depth of this configuration is 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, its breakdown is easily seen to be 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{k}{2}$
\end_inset

; one would need to replace half of the planes adjacent to one of the faces
 with planes of the opposite colour.
 This gives rise to the following conjecture, which generalises Corollary
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "cor:The-breakdown-point"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Conjecture
The breakdown point of Manski's estimator in covariate dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is bounded above by 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2(1+d)}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The generalisation of Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "lem:Finite sample breakdown, d = 1"

\end_inset

 is likely false.
 The reason is that a point of maximal colour depth can have 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

independent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 witnessing lines, in the sense that swapping the colours of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}/2$
\end_inset

 points on one witnessing line doesn't necessarily make every other witnessing
 line get its colour depth pushed down to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 However, that the finite sample breakdown point is bounded 
\emph on
below
\emph default
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}/2$
\end_inset

 is probably easy to show.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Conjecture
The finite sample breakdown point of Manski's estimator in covariate dimension
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is bounded below by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}/2$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The breakdown point will probably be very close to this in any case.
 It seems difficult to analyse how and when the phenomenon above occurs,
 and how bad it could be.
 We leave attempted proofs or disproofs of these conjectures to another
 time, but we're not entirely done with the topic of robustness, as empirical
 robustness studies are included in the next section.

\begin_layout Subsection
The role of the covariates' distribution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Manski's estimator (in 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1$
\end_inset

) has large problems estimating values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}$
\end_inset

 that are close to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 Essentially, this is because the candidate intervals 
\begin_inset Formula $<-\frac{1}{x_{i}},-\frac{1}{x_{j}}>$
\end_inset

 require some very large 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

s in order to get close to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
 Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim}N(0,1)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=1_{[1+0\cdot X_{i}+\epsilon_{i}\geq0]}$
\end_inset

, and for simplicity that the optimal set is 
\begin_inset Formula $<-\frac{1}{x_{i}},-\frac{1}{x_{j}}>$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}=\max X_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Say we want an 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 such that the lower bound 
\begin_inset Formula $0>-\frac{1}{x_{i}}>-0.20$
\end_inset

 holds with probability at least 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$
\end_inset

.
 This requires at least one observation greater than 5, and this happens
 with probability greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\approx2418000$
\end_inset

.
 If the 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{i}$
\end_inset

s are Cauchy, the lower bound is 
\begin_inset Formula $n=11$
\end_inset

, an enormous difference.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
For both these observations we use that the distribution of the maximum
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $F(x)^{n}$
\end_inset

, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $P(\max X_{i}>a)=1-F(a)^{n}=0.5$
\end_inset

.
 The values can then be found using logarithms and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{R}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Note that the estimator will, correctly, find an optimal set covering 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, but it will take an absurdly large 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 to get this interval small.
 This also shows that a form of assumption 2c (at the beginning of Section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Manski Asymptotics"

\end_inset

) is required for consistency: If the covariates were uniformly distributed
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $[-a,a]$
\end_inset

, for instance, the infimal modulus of a candidate solution is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{a}$
\end_inset

, which will not be enough to assure consistency whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{1}<\frac{1}{a}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As seen in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "fig:Pretty figure"

\end_inset

, there are similar problems in covariate dimensions greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 For a line in the dual plane to come close to a 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\sim(0,0)$
\end_inset

, it will require an intercept close to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, which can happen only if 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 is very large.
 This reasoning clearly extends to arbitrary dimensions.

Horowitz' distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since Manski's estimator has cube root asymptotics, we expect it to perform
 very badly in the MSE-sense versus probit or logit whenever the assumptions
 on probit and logit are almost true.
 We simulate the MSE for several choices of covariate and error distributions
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $d=2$
\end_inset

.
 Also, we study the relative robustness properties under the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

-contamination model.
 For all simulations in this section we select the first computed vertex
 of the solution set as an estimate.
 We compute the ML estimator for the logistic regression model (logit),
 so that we have something to compare the results to.
 Due to the very high variance of Manski's estimator, its only fair shot
 at overpowering the logit is for its bias to be much smaller.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is very small, the variance will dominate the bias.
 Still, we report the 
\begin_inset Formula $MSE$
\end_inset

, variance and bias for completeness.

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=1$
\end_inset

, a choice made to please the slow computers at that time.
 It only requires a small modification of the one-dimensional algorithm
 to accommodate to this change.
 While Horowitz compared Manski's estimator, logistic regression and his
 own smoothed maximum score estimator, we compare Manski's estimator and
 logistic regression.
 Initially we calculated the values for probit regression as well, but as
 they are very similar to logit they are omitted.

\begin_layout Standard
The results in Figure

\end_inset

 are similar to those of Horowitz, with the exception of logit is MSE for
 
\begin_inset Formula $H$
\end_inset

.
 Horowitz obtained much higher values here, which might be explained by
 the fact that he used 
\begin_inset Formula $N=1,000$
\end_inset

 replications and we used 
\begin_inset Formula $N=10,000$
\end_inset

.
 As it turns out, Horowitz' choice of distributions, covariates and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

s does not paint of an unbiased picture of the situation.
 Some cases of interest are not covered, most notably non-symmetric distribution
s, extremely heavy-tailed distributions and combinations of heteroskedasticity
 with these features.
 we will study these wild distributions in the next section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Wild distributions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We extend the Monte Carlo study to cover a non-symmetric distribution with
 support bounded to the left (adjusted standard log normal), an extremely
 heavytailed distribution (the Cauchy distribution), a skewed distribution
 with support on 
\begin_inset Formula $(-\infty,\infty)$
\end_inset

, the skewed 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

-distribution (
\begin_inset Formula $\nu=3$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma=3$
\end_inset

, adjusted to have median equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

), and a bimodal equal weight mixture of 
\begin_inset Formula $N(-1,1)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N(1,1)$
\end_inset

.
 In addition, we will consider homoskedastic and heteroskedastic variants
 of the log-normal, Cauchy and the bimodal mixture.
 The heteroskedasticity will be of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{X_{1i}^{2}+X_{2i}^{2}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp\left(-X_{1}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The results are found in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "tab:Wild distributions"

\end_inset

.
 The reduced bias of Manski's estimator is large enough to compensate for
 its increased variance in some cases, most notably for the heteroskedastic
 log-normals.

\begin_layout Subsection
Contaminated data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We perform a small Monte Carlo study on contaminated data.
 The basic setup is 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}=1_{[1+\beta_{1}X_{1i}+\beta_{2}X_{2i}+\epsilon_{i}]},$
\end_inset

 where the covariates are standard normal and the 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon_{i}$
\end_inset

s are standard logistic.
 We consider three different forms of contamination:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
(
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

-contamination).
 The contaminated data comes from the same model, but with the 
\begin_inset Formula $Y_{i}$
\end_inset

s swapped.
 The contamination rate is denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
(
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

-contamination).
 The contaminated data is from the same model, but a random covariate is
 multiplied by 10.
 The contamination rate is denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A combination of these two: A< fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 of the the data is 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

-contaminated and a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 of the data is 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

-contaminated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both kinds of contaminations can be though of as clerical errors; in the
 second case, a decimal is misplaced, while the first corresponds to pressing
 the one wrong button out of two.
 Also, these different forms of contamination can be seen as logistic regression
 analogues of outliers in the 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

-direction and outliers in the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

-direction from regression analysis, discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "introduction"
key "rousseeuw2005robust"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will let 
\begin_inset Formula $(\beta_{1},\beta_{2})=(1,1)$
\end_inset

, and will only report 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\beta_{1}}$
\end_inset

 due to readability and the symmetry involved here: There is no systematic
 difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\beta_{1}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\beta_{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 we will consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0,0.05,0.1.0.2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0,0.1,0.5$
\end_inset

.
 The contamination rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 is taken into the analysis in order to have a baseline we can compare with,
 while the other choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 are sort of arbitrary.
 It should be clear that too large values of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

, for instance 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\approx0.5$
\end_inset

, aren't worth studying, especially with the breakdown point of Manski’s
 estimator in mind.
 We settle on 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0.4$
\end_inset

 and expect things to go wrong.
 We let 
\begin_inset Formula $n=800$
\end_inset

, typical of mid-large scale logistic setup.
 Also, the replication count is 
\begin_inset Formula $N=10,000$
\end_inset

, which might be too small to catch all that is happening.
 Nonetheless, the results, reported in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Robust table"

\end_inset

, are illustrating.
 Not surprisingly, things go out of control with 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=0.4$
\end_inset

.
 As can be seen, 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

-contamination alone has little effect on the bias of the logistic regression
 estimator, though the variance increases.
 Hence it is still able to see the signal under these circumstances.
 Since the variance of logit is very much smaller than the base variance
 of Manski's estimator, Manski's estimator has to perform very well on the
 bias side of things in order to out-perform logit MSE-wise.
 Luckily for Manski's estimator, it does better than logit for any combination
 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\neq0,0.4$
\end_inset

, which suggests usefulness as a robust estimator in practice.

- Jean-François Lyotard in 
\emph on
The Postmodern Condition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As per Lyotard's dictum, we study density estimation on the unit interval
 by means of step functions.
 The object of our attention is the
\emph on
 irregular histogram
\emph default
, the main worked-out example of cube root asymptotics in this thesis.
 The study of this histogram is easiest when restricted to the unit interval,
 whence the name of this chapter.
 We start out by discussing the important class of density estimators known
 as 
\emph on
kernel density estimators
\emph default
 (KDEs), with special focus on the 
\emph on
Gaussian copula KDE
\emph default
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 In Section 2 we define a rather large class of histogram estimators defined
 through the minimisation of statistical divergences.
 Our focus will be on the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-divergence will also have a role to play.
 Section 3 is a tiny one, being entirely about regular histograms.
 Section 4 is devoted to the question of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

-consistency of the histograms.
 In Section 5, the longest section of this thesis, we will prove consistency
 of the irregular histograms introduced in Section 2, under certain conditions,
 using the theory developed in Chapter 2.
 In particular we will make use of a 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta>0$
\end_inset

 in order to uniformly bound the maximised objective function.
 We will also use the rate theorem in order to establish the cube root rate
 of convergence for the split points and weights of these histograms.
 In Section 6 we discuss algorithms for the computation of irregular histograms
 given some data 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 As was the case with Manski's estimator, the usual tools of gradient descent
 will not be available, and we will be forced to find other ways to deal
 with the problem.
 In the process, we show that the histograms are computable in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{2}k)$
\end_inset

 time.
 In Section 7 we describe a frequent anomaly encountered when using these
 histograms, and a potential remedy.
 The penultimate section is devoted to an illustration of the histogram
 on some examples of real data, including an application of the subsampling
 bootstrap in order to get confidence intervals for the split points.
 Finally, the last section is devoted to the description and investigation
 of the 
\emph on

a generalisation of AIC to the setting of irregular histograms.
 It turns out that the bias term is difficult to estimate, but a subsampling
 approach appears to work fine.

\begin_layout Subsection
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important class of non-parametric density estimators are the kernel density
 estimators (KDEs), which we now describe.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\sim F$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 has a strictly positive smooth density 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 be a function which is symmetric around 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and positive.
 The kernel density estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{f}(x)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{h}K\left(\frac{x-X_{i}}{h}\right),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 is the (data dependent) bandwidth.
 Choices for 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 include any density function symmetric around 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, e.g the standard normal distribution, the Epanechnikov kernel and the tricube
 kernel 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 We will discuss this concept in the context of histograms in Section 4.4.
 A widely used criterion for selecting the bandwidth is to minimise the
 
\emph on
integrated mean squared error
\emph default
, that is 
\begin_inset Formula $\int E(f(x)-\widehat{f}(x))^{2}dx$
\end_inset

.
 As usual, the mean squared error is used mainly due its mathematical tractabili
ty, and the interpretation is simple enough.
 By Fubini's theorem it equals 
\begin_inset Formula $E\int(f(x)-\hat{f}(x))dx$
\end_inset

, which gives rise to its acronym, MISE (mean integrated squared error).
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f}$
\end_inset

 is a random function, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{f}(x)$
\end_inset

 is the random variable we're taking expectations with regards to.
 From a given criterion, like the MISE or pointwise MSE, the optimal bandwidth
 is the bandwidth 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{n}$
\end_inset

 which minimises the criterion.
 For these criteria (which are the ones we will consider), the optimal bandwidth
 can be understood as making a balanced trade-off between variance and bias.
 Through asymptotics and straightforward calculations we find that the optimal
 bandwidth has order 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-\frac{1}{5}}$

\begin_layout Standard
Several methods are used to compare different density estimation procedures,
 where by procedure we understand a method which does everything automatically,
 including the selection of a bandwidth.
 An example of such a procedure is the normal reference rule for KDEs with
 Gaussian kernels.
 Perhaps the most prominent method of comparison is the use of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-distances and Hellinger distances, obtained through simulations on a suitable
 selection of prototype densities.

 studying densities on the unit interval.
 Assume our density looks like the one in the plot: It has high density

 Since there is no data to the left of

\begin_layout Standard
Seemingly, the source of boundary bias is that symmetric kernels can't take
 into account that there exists regions with no data whatsoever.
 A reasonable solution is to use a semi-flexible non-symmetric kernel which
 continuously manipulates the support.
 Chen's

 proposal is to use,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $a,b$

 This is not a bona fide density, however, for 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 proposed an elegant modification of the beta kernel approach.
 The idea is to use the conditionals of a bivariate Gaussian copula as kernels.
 The bivariate Gaussian copula is a random variable of one parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho$
\end_inset

, defined in the following manner: Let 
\begin_inset Formula $(Z_{1},Z_{2})\sim N_{2}(0,\Sigma)$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma=\left[\begin{array}{cc}
1 & \rho\\
\rho & 1
\end{array}\right],$
\end_inset

 and put 
\begin_inset Formula $(X_{1},X_{2})=(\Phi(Z_{1}),\Phi(Z_{2}))$
\end_inset

.
 Its density is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c(x_{1},x_{2};\rho)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\rho^{2}}}\exp\left(-\frac{\left[\rho^{2}(\Phi^{-1}(x_{1})^{2}-2\rho\Phi^{-1}(x_{1})\Phi^{-1}(x_{2})+\rho^{2}(\Phi^{-1}(x_{2}))^{2}\right]}{2(1-\rho^{2})}\right).
\]

\end_inset

The basic feature of a copula is that the marginals are uniform, but the
 conditionals can be very rich.

 The Gaussian copula kernel estimator is the mixture 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\xi_{i}\left[Y_{i}|y_{2}=X_{i}\right]$

\begin_inset Formula $\xi=(\xi_{1},\xi_{2},...,\xi_{n})$

\begin_layout Standard
For use in pre-smoothing of histograms (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Presmoothing-and-instability"

\end_inset

), we will need to sample from this estimator.
 As a first step, we must sample from the conditional distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $c(x_{1}\mid X_{2};\rho)$
\end_inset

.
 Recall the formulas for the conditional mean and variance in a bivariate
 normal 
\begin_inset Formula $(Z_{1},Z_{2})$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mu_{1}|Z_{2} & = & \mu_{1}+\frac{\rho}{\sigma_{2}^{2}}(Z_{2}-\mu_{2}),\\
\sigma_{1}^{2}|Z_{2} & = & \sigma_{1}^{2}-\frac{\rho^{2}}{\sigma_{2}^{2}},
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

which in our setting translates to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu|Z_{2}=\rho Z_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}|Z_{2}=1-\rho^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Using these formulas together with the fact that the conditional distributions
 are normal, we sample from 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{X_{2}}\sim N(\rho\Phi^{-1}(X_{2}),1-\rho^{2})$
\end_inset

 and apply 
\begin_inset Formula $\Phi$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1}|X_{2}\sim\Phi(Z_{X_{2}})$
\end_inset

.
 It is now straight forward to sample from the Gaussian copula density estimator.

\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\sigma},$

\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\mu}$
\end_inset

 are the maximum likelihood estimates of the probit-transformed data (see
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 A natural extension of the Gaussian copula KDE to the realm of derivatives
 is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\widehat{f'}(x;h)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{d}{dx}c(x,X_{i};1-h^{2}).
\]

\end_inset

Here the optimal rate for the bandwidth has been reduced from 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-\frac{1}{5}}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-\frac{1}{7}}$
\end_inset

.
 This is not surprising, as there is seemingly a larger inherent difficulty
 involved in the estimating derivatives 
\emph on

 This manifests itself through a much larger pointwise variance as a function
 of

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}=0$

\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}=1$

\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}<a_{i+1}$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}<0$
\end_inset

 are weights summing to one; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 be a suitable class of densities on the unit interval.
 The exact nature of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 will vary from problem to problem, and isn't very important right now.
 Later on, when we derive our limiting distributions, the exact nature of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
is 
\emph default
important --- it contains only smooth densities and no densities with the
 shape of a histogram.
 Whenever we have a 
\begin_inset Formula $P\in\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

, with associated density 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, we can define its 
\emph on
best approximating histogram
\emph default
 through the minimisation of statistical divergences, which we will also
 call statistical distances.
 A statistical divergence is defined as follows: Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 be space of probability measures with common support.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $d:\mathcal{P}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 is a function such that 
\begin_inset Formula $d(f,g)\geq0$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $f,g\in\mathcal{P}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d(f,g)=0$
\end_inset

 iff 
\begin_inset Formula $f=g$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will consider two divergences:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
1.) Kullback-Leibler divergence.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The quantity is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{KL}(f,h)=\int f(x)\log\frac{f(x)}{h(x)}dx$
\end_inset

.
 In ordinary parametric statistics, minimising this distance is equivalent
 to finding the maximum likelihood estimate.
 It is an information theoretic distance, and is difficult to understand
 visually.
 Accordingly, it can be argued that it is inappropriate for histograms.
 As we will see, it is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-minimisation in regular histograms, and it is asymptotically equivalent
 to the minimisation of the Hellinger distance, which is more easily interpretab
le visually, and is arguably more adequate than the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-distance.
 The minimisation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence is equivalent to the
 maximisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\int f(x)\log h(x)dx=P\log h$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i-1}-a}1_{[a_{i-1},a_{i})}(x)$
\end_inset

, we get the criterion function 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
m_{(a,w)}^{KL}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}1_{[a_{i-1},a_{i})}(x),\label{eq:KL objective}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the desired argmax objective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Pm_{(a,w)}^{KL}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}P[a_{i-1},a_{i}).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
2.) 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-distance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is the ordinary 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-norm, defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $\int(f(x)-h(x))^{2}dx=\int f(x)^{2}dx-2\int f(x)h(x)+\int h(x)^{2}dx$
\end_inset

.
 This is a classical distance measure which is easy to interpret, but it
 weights small distances too little.
 For histograms, to minimise the expression above is equivalent to the maximisat
ion of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
Pm_{(a,w)}^{L_{2}}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}\frac{(2P[a_{i-1},a_{i})-w_{i})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}},
\]

\end_inset

with underlying criterion function 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
m_{(a,w)}^{L_{2}}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\left[\frac{2w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}1_{[a_{i-1},a_{i})}(x)-\frac{w_{i}^{2}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right],\label{eq:L2 objective}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

as can be seen by straight forward calculations.
 We require the assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $f\in L_{2}$
\end_inset

 for this to work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph*
Special mention: The Hellinger distance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Hellinger distance is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $d(f,h)=\frac{1}{2}\int(\sqrt{f(x)}-\sqrt{h(x)})^{2}dx$
\end_inset

, which behaves asymptotically like Kullback-Leibler.
 Compared to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, it has the nice property of
 being an actual metric, and it is easier to understand visually.
 When taking roots, values below one are pushed upwards, and values above
 one are pushed downwards.
 This makes the distance perhaps more appropriate for histograms than 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

, which weight differences when densities are high more than differences
 when densities are small.
 To minimise the Hellinger distance is equivalent to maximising
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{k}\sqrt{\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}}\int_{a_{i-1}}^{a_{i}}\sqrt{f(x)}dx,
\]

\end_inset

which requires an estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{f}(x)$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

, for instance a Gaussian copula kernel density estimate.
 However, this is hardly an argument against the use of the Hellinger distance,
 as it is convenient to use kernel density estimates for all sorts of histograms.

Kinds of histograms.

\begin_layout Standard
Given a statistical distance, we can define three forms of histograms.
 Their forms are decided by which quantities we allow to vary and which
 we force to be constant.
 
\emph on
Regular histogram
\emph default
 are histograms with a fixed bin width and variable weight, which in this
 case equals height times the bin width.
 These are the objects we usually associate with histograms.
 
\emph on
Irregular histograms 
\emph default
are usually understood as histograms with variable bin width and variable
 weight, but we will also consider irregular histograms with fixed weight
 and variable bin width.
 We will sometimes call these irregular histograms 
\emph on
quantile histograms.

 manipulate the height of the left-most bar, it has been forced to become
 too tall.
 The same goes for the the middle section, since it cannot manipulate the
 weights, it is forced to underestimate the density, even tough it approximates
 its shape quite well.
 The same mechanism forces the bin widths to be small around the high regions,
 explaining the difference between its looks and that of the irregular histogram

\begin_layout Proposition
For regular histograms, minimisation of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 and Kullback-Leibler divergences are equivalent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
(
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

) Recall that the objective function for minimisation is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(w)=-2\sum_{i=1}^{k}P(a_{i-1},a_{i})w_{i}+\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}^{2},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}=1$
\end_inset

, together with the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}\geq0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Using Lagrange multipliers, with constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $g=\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}=1,$
\end_inset

 we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial(f+g)(w)}{\partial w_{i}}=-2P(a_{i-1},a_{i})+2w_{i}+\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Leave 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 alone on the right hand side and sum over 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to get 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

, which yields the unique solution 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=P(a_{i-1},a_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}\geq0$
\end_inset

 is automatically fulfilled.
 As for Kullback-Leibler, we use the same method on 
\begin_inset Formula $f(w)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}P(a_{i-1},a_{i})\log w_{i}$
\end_inset

 to get 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\partial(f+g)(w)}{\partial w_{i}}=P(a_{i-1},a_{i})\frac{1}{w_{i}}+\lambda$
\end_inset

, which gives 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=-1$
\end_inset

 and the maximum 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=P(a_{i-1},a_{i})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By using the finite sample analogue 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}(a_{i-1},a_{i})$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $P(a_{i-1},a_{i})$
\end_inset

, we see that both the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

 regular histograms correspond to the ordinary regular histograms we know
 from elementary school.
 The following corollary tells us that 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 irregular histograms (with variable weights) are histograms as we know
 them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Corollary
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "prop:Good histograms"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 be a probability measure on 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 The optimal weights for both the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

 irregular histograms are 
\begin_inset Formula $P([a_{i-1},a_{i}))$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the optimal split points.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Given the split points, the problem reduces to that of the previous proposition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We call this, colloquially, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

good histogram property
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 In addition to making the resulting histograms correspond to ordinary histogram
s as we know them, the property effectively reduces the dimension of the
 objective function.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now that we have defined the best approximating histogram for the underlying
 distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

, we will discuss their estimation.
 This estimation is carried out by using the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

plug in estimator
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}$
\end_inset

 in place of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

.
 Thus
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
(\widehat{a},\widehat{w})=\argmax_{(a,w)}P_{n}m_{(a,w)},
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{(a,w)}=m_{(a,w)}^{L_{2}}$
\end_inset

 if we want to minimise the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 distance, and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{(a,w)}=m_{(a,w)}^{KL}$
\end_inset

 for Kullback-Leibler.
 For ease of exposition, we always include both 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

 in the arguments of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, even tough we are allowed to pre-specify their values, a choice that hopefully
 will not cause confusion.
 Note that this is the setting of 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

-estimation, discussed Section 2.2.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other divergences that might be considered are the BHHJ divergences 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "basu1998robust"

\end_inset

, a parametrized family of divergences defined by 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{\alpha}(f,g)=\int\left[f^{1+\alpha}(z)-(1+\frac{1}{\alpha})g(z)f^{\alpha}(z)+\frac{1}{\alpha}g^{1+\alpha}(z)\right]dz
\]

\end_inset

for 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{0}(f,g)=d_{KL}(f,g)$
\end_inset

.
 These divergences were developed for outlier robust statistics, and don't
 seem very relevant for the case at hand.
 Nonetheless, they will allow us make a finer trade-off between the features
 of the Kullback-Leibler histograms and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-histograms, and would connect the limiting distributions of these two in
 a unifying manner.
 Still, the rather similar behaviour of the Kullback-Leibler and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-histograms, illustrated in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Presmoothing-and-instability"

\end_inset

, makes it seem like this isn't worth the effort.
 Finally, there are other important distances we have not investigated at
 all, for instance the Kolmogorov distance defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{K}(F,G)=\sup_{x}|F(x)-G(x)|$
\end_inset

, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

-distance, 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{L_{1}}=\int|f(x)-g(x)|dx$
\end_inset

.
 The Kolmogorov is a global distance measure, and isn't appropriate for
 density estimation.
 While the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

-distance is arguably the most appropriate distance measure between densities,
 it is difficult to work with.
 By Scheffé's identity (see Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:L1-consistency"

\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

-consistency), minimising the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

 criterion is equivalent to the minimisation of the 
\emph on
total variational distance, 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{TV}(f,g)=\sup_{B\in\mathscr{B}}|\int_{B}f(x)dx-\int_{B}g(x)dx|$
\end_inset

, 
\emph default
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{B}$
\end_inset


\emph on
 
\emph default
is the Borel 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

-algebra on 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 This is particularly attractive, as it minimises the maximal error of 
\begin_inset Formula $|\widehat{P}(A)-P(A)|$
\end_inset

 across 
\emph on
every 
\emph default
measurable set 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp

\end_inset

 argue that both the 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

- and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-distances are fundamentally inappropriate as criteria for density estimation,
 but their examples of bad properties for these two distances only hold
 for unbounded intervals.
 Nevertheless, minimising 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{TV}(f,g)=\sup_{B\in\mathscr{B}}|\int_{B}f(x)dx-\int_{B}g(x)dx|$
\end_inset

 is likely not amenable to the techniques described in Section

\begin_layout Standard
A proof is found in e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

 We could also use the ideas of Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:M-estimation"

\end_inset

, or more specifically the rate theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "thm:rate theorem"

\end_inset

 to find the limiting covariance structure and the Hessian 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 In order to put quantile estimation into this, we could use the loss function
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{p}(x,q)=\begin{cases}
(1-p)|x-q| & \textrm{when }x<q,\\
p|x-q| & \textrm{when }x\geq q.
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

This function has the property that 
\begin_inset Formula $\argmin_{q}Ed_{p}(X,q)=F^{-1}(p)$
\end_inset

 (see e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
after "p. 21"
key "hao2007quantile"

\end_inset

).
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{p}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}d_{p_{i}}(\cdot,q_{i})$
\end_inset

 is a suitable objective function, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is constrained to be an increasing vector in 
\begin_inset Formula $(0,1)$
\end_inset

 Notice that when 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\frac{1}{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is the median.
 The objective function is 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{\frac{1}{2}}(x;q)\propto|x-q|$
\end_inset

, which was used when we established the limiting distribution of the median,
 recall Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "thm:median theorem"

\end_inset

.
 It would be interesting to find out whether there is a statistical divergence
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\argmax_{q}d(h(x;q,k^{-1}),f(x))$
\end_inset

 equals the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-spacing estimate.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This method can clearly be extended to choices of non-equally spaced quantiles.
 This variant of the quantile histogram is probably better than what we
 obtain through 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

 It retains the positive property of quantile histograms, namely that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{i}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th quantile of 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x)$
\end_inset

 estimates we soon will describe (in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Presmoothing-and-instability"

\end_inset

), the split points have 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}$
\end_inset

-asymptotics, its limiting distribution is normal.
 It is computationally very inexpensive to construct, as finding the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 quantiles is done in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n\log n)$
\end_inset

 time.
 Also, they look roughly the same whenever the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

 histograms have been estimated properly.
 As the main purpose of histograms is visualisation, this is yet another
 point in favour of this variant.
 If the goal of constructing a histogram is compression instead, this approach
 should also be preferable, as the quantiles themselves are very well understood.
 Another point in its favour is the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}/KL$
\end_inset

 quantile histograms can fool us in a subtle way: In figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Kinds of histograms"

\end_inset

, notice that the quantile histograms seem to 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

focus
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 on the region around the mode.
 This makes it seem intuitive that the estimator is more accurate in exactly
 this region.
 But as we can see from the plot, this is not the case.
 The regular quantile histogram doesn't suffer from this defect.

In our setting,

Let

where 
\begin_inset Formula $m(\mathcal{A}_{n})=\max(|\pi|\mid\pi\in\mathcal{A}_{n})$

\begin_layout Proof
We define 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x;\pi)=P(\pi[x])$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{n}(x;\pi)=P_{n}(\pi[x])$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{U}_{\pi}$
\end_inset

 be the set of all sets which can be written as a union of elements from
 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{A\in\pi}|P_{n}(A)-P(A)| & = & \int|f_{n}(x;\pi)-f(x;\pi)|dx\\
 & = & 2\sup_{A\in\mathcal{\mathcal{U}}}|\int_{A}\left(f_{n}(x;\pi)-f(x;\pi)\right)dx|,
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

by Scheffé's theorem.
 Now define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{U}^{\mathcal{A}_{n}}=\cup_{\pi\in\mathcal{A}}\mathcal{U}_{\pi}$
\end_inset

, and obtain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sup_{\pi\in\mathcal{A}_{n}}\sum_{A\in\pi}|P_{n}(A)-P(A)| & = & 2\sup_{A\in\mathcal{U}^{\mathcal{A}_{n}}}|\int_{U}\left(f_{n}(x;\pi)-f(x;\pi)\right)dx|\\
 & = & 2\sup_{A\in\mathcal{U}^{\mathcal{A}_{n}}}|P_{n}(A)-P(A)|.

\end_inset

By the Vapnik-Chervonenkis inequality, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula

\]

\end_inset

Now we need to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}_{2n}(\mathcal{U}^{\mathcal{A}_{n}})\leq\Delta_{2n}^{*}(\mathcal{A}_{n})2^{m(\mathcal{A})}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $B\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$

 We can then assume that each 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}$
\end_inset

 The number of such 
\begin_inset Formula $U_{i}$

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

 By the triangle inequality, it suffices to show that both

 almost surely.
 For the first integral,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

In order to use Corollary

\end_inset

 to conclude 
\begin_inset Formula $\int|\widehat{f_{n}}(x)-f_{n}(x)|dx\to0$
\end_inset

, we have to verify condition a) and b) of that corollary.
 a) Is true since 
\begin_inset Formula $m(\mathcal{A})=k_{n}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}n^{-1}\to0$
\end_inset

 by assumption.
 To verify b) is slightly more involved.
 For each 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\Delta_{n}^{*}(\mathcal{A}_{n})$
\end_inset

 equals the number of ways 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 points can be partitioned into 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{n}$
\end_inset

 intervals.
 It can be shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-1}\log(\Delta_{n}^{*}(\mathcal{A}_{n}))\leq2h(\frac{k}{n+k})\to0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $h$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
As for the other integral,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}

 & \leq & 2P(A).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

it is time to make use of assumption (b).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\pi}^{\star}$
\end_inset

 be the union of all 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\pi$
\end_inset

 with diameter greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

.
 Then there are maximally 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma^{-1}$
\end_inset

 such intervals, as more would require an interval of length greater than
 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $P(A_{\pi}^{\star})\leq\frac{1}{\gamma}\max P(A)$
\end_inset

, which is almost surely less than 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

 in the limit (simply chose 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon\gamma$
\end_inset

 in assumption (b)).
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda[0,1]=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 is a partition, the event
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula

The content of our modification is, besides the simplification to

 These conditions are more in line with the rest of our discussion.

 were included.

\begin_layout Standard
It follows immediately that regular histograms with bin widths going to
 zero are 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

-consistent.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-spacing density estimates are also consistent, which follows from the fact
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}[\widehat{a_{i-1}},\widehat{a_{i}})=k^{-1}$
\end_inset

 by construction and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sup_{i}|P_{n}[\widehat{a_{i-1}},\widehat{a_{i}})-P[\widehat{a_{i-1}},\widehat{a}_{i})|\stackrel{a.s.}{\to}0$
\end_inset

 by the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem; hence (b) is satisfied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $KL/L_{2}$
\end_inset

-histograms with variable weights.
 It appears difficult to find simple conditions which makes condition (b)
 true.
 In the next section we will prove consistency of the split points for these
 histograms, and in the process we introduce a 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta>0$
\end_inset

 which provides bounds on how small the windows can be.
 It is natural to let 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{k}\to0$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 increases, and analogously, we can provide a sequence 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{k}\to0$
\end_inset

 which forces (b) to be true by the same Glivenko-Cantelli argument as above.
 We arrive at the following proposition:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "prop:L1 consistency"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{h}(x)$
\end_inset

 be the 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-histogram with variable weights constructed from 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{h}\stackrel{L_{1}}{\to f}$
\end_inset

 almost surely, provided the bin widths are kept smaller than 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{k}$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{k}\to0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that condition (b) is false for several histograms that probably
 are consistent.
 For instance, let 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 be the density given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
f(x)=\alpha\begin{cases}
(1-x)^{2}, & \textrm{when }x\leq\nicefrac{1}{2},\\
\nicefrac{1}{4}, & \textrm{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\frac{5}{12}$
\end_inset

 is the norming constant.
 The true split points of the 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

/
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-histograms will be have 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{a}_{k-1}\approx0.5$
\end_inset

, when 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is large enough, but should be consistent provided 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)=3(1-x)^{2}$
\end_inset

 is.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While the irregular histograms are as much about the placing of the split
 points as the fact that they are good histograms (recall the definition
 following Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:Good histograms"

\end_inset

), Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:L1 consistency"

\end_inset

 only makes use of the fact that they are good histograms, and do not say
 anything about the limit properties of the split points.
 It appears plausible that condition 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathbb{P}[\max_{i=1,...,k-1}P[\widehat{a_{i-1}},\widehat{a_{i}})>\gamma]\stackrel{a.s}{\to}0\mbox{ for every }\gamma>0,
\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:L1 consistency condition"

\end_inset

 holds when we restrict our attention to densities 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 which are nowhere locally constant (
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 there is no 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f((x-\delta,x+\delta))=c$
\end_inset

).
 Anyhow, since the histograms are consistent for any such choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{k}$
\end_inset

, the question of consistency without 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{k}$
\end_inset

s is not tremendously important.
 A possible approach to verifying the condition is to 1.) Prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $\max_{i=1,...,k-1}P[a_{i-1},a_{i})<\gamma$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i-1},a_{i}$
\end_inset

 are the true split points of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently large, and 2.) Find a probabilistic bound on the difference
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}(|P[\widehat{a_{i-1}},\widehat{a_{i}})-P[a_{i-1},a_{i})|>\epsilon)$
\end_inset

.
 An example of such a bound, albeit in a situation more akin to that of
 Manski's estimator, can be found in

-histograms with constant weights, the same reasoning can't be used, since
 Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 only applies to good histograms.
 One idea to explore is whether the constant weight histograms behave asymptotic
ally like good histograms in some sense.
 For instance, one could explore the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

-distance between the variable weight 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$

\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{a}$

 with constant weights.

\end_inset

Does this converge to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-1}k\to0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k\to\infty$
\end_inset

? (Or at some slower rate, like 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-1}e^{k}\to0$
\end_inset

?) Another possibility is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{a}$
\end_inset

 gets asymptotically close to the vector of 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{-1}$
\end_inset

-quantiles 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $k\to\infty$

 Finally, these options might fail, and we would need an entirely different

\begin_layout Standard
(A3) the Hessian

\begin_layout Standard
(A4) there is a unique, well-separated maximiser of the objective function;
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(A5) it satisfies the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}\neq\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}$

\begin_inset Formula $i$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Condition A1 and A2 can be weakened, as we strictly speaking only require
 them to be non-zero and differentiable in neighbourhoods around the points
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,k-1$
\end_inset

.
 But this relaxed condition is elusive and difficult to verify.
 Conditions A1 and A2 tell us which setting we're in: Most importantly,
 we are in a smooth world.
 A3 is needed in order to make the limiting distribution make sense and
 handy for making sure the estimates are consistent.
 A4 is an identifiability condition: Without it there is no unique histogram
 which minimises the distance between the underlying 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and itself, so it is a natural condition.
 A5 is necessary to ascertain 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\frac{1}{3}}$
\end_inset

-convergence, in particular for condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "eq:Uniformity condition"

\end_inset

 to hold.
 We will also establish a result for an alternative condition to A5, namely
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(A5') 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 satisfies the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}=\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$

\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}$
\end_inset

-rate to a normal distribution!

\begin_layout Standard
First we will prove consistency of the estimates 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{a},\widehat{w}$
\end_inset

.
 Recall the Consistency Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vpageref
reference "thm:Consistency theorem"

\end_inset

, which states that we only need to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$
\end_inset

 is Glivenko-Cantelli for consistency to hold whenever the maximum is well-separ
ated.
 We have already assumed that the maximum is well-separated in A3, which
 seems reasonable, although we will not attempt to prove or find any necessary
 or sufficient conditions for this condition to hold in this thesis.
 In order to cope with unboundedness we slightly modify the set of allowed
 values 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 with the additional constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}-a_{i-1}\geq\delta$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta>0$
\end_inset

 is arbitrary.
 We denote an 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}$
\end_inset

 modified in such a way by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{S}_{\delta}$
\end_inset

 and go on to prove that the 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

 histogram with constant weights is Glivenko-Cantelli for every fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
The class 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}=\left\{ m_{a}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\log\frac{k^{-1}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}1_{[a_{i-1},a_{i})}\mid a\in\mathcal{S_{\delta}}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is Glivenko-Cantelli for any choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
By theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "thm:Bracket GC theorem"

\end_inset

 it suffices to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{[]}(\epsilon,\mathcal{F},L_{1}(P))<\infty$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset

 sufficiently small.
 We show this in detail for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

.
 We define the following functions 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{a,\eta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{a,\eta}$
\end_inset

 by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
l_{a,\eta}(x) & = & -\log(a+\eta)1_{[0,a-\eta)}(x)-\log(1-a+\eta)1_{[a-\eta,1]}(x),\\
u_{a,\eta}(x) & = & -\log(a-\eta)1_{[0,a+\eta)}(x)-\log(1-a+\eta)1_{[a+\eta,1]}(x),
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

when 
\begin_inset Formula $a<0.5$
\end_inset

, where the signs in the indicator functions are flipped whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $a\geq0.5$
\end_inset

.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{a,\eta}\leq m_{a+\xi}\leq u_{a,\eta}$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi<\eta$
\end_inset

, which can be verified by inspecting the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{a}.$
\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}(\lambda)$
\end_inset

-distance between these brackets is 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & \left[\log(a+\eta)-\log(a-\eta)\right](a-\eta)\\
 & + & \left[\log(1-a+\eta)-\log(a-\eta)\right]2\eta\\
 & + & \left[\log(1-a+\eta)-\log(a+\eta)\right](1-a+\eta).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

This simplifies to 
\begin_inset Formula $2\eta|\log(1-a)-\log(a)|$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

 is close to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 (higher order terms are discarded).
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $a\geq\delta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1-a\geq\delta$
\end_inset

 by our previously imposed constraint, the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}(\lambda)$
\end_inset

-distances are bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon=4\eta\log(\delta^{-1})$
\end_inset

.
 Now assume 
\begin_inset Formula $P\ll\lambda$
\end_inset

, and notice that the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}(P)$
\end_inset

-distance is bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula $12\eta\log(\delta^{-1})$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently small.
 The increased bound is due to the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 might have all its mass inbetween 
\begin_inset Formula $a-\eta$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a+\eta$
\end_inset

.
 In conclusion, we need 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\eta^{-1}}{2}=6\epsilon^{-1}\log(\delta^{-1})$
\end_inset

 such brackets, hence the covering number 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{[]}(\epsilon,\mathcal{F},L_{1}(P))\leq6\epsilon^{-1}\log(\delta^{-1})<\infty$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon>0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We extended this technique, not entirely rigorously, to the case of an arbitrary
 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 We define 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-variate generalisations of 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{a,\eta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{a,\eta}$
\end_inset

 in a similar manner as above: We let 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{a,\eta}(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\log\frac{k^{-1}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}+\eta}1_{A_{i}^{\eta}},$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}^{\eta}=[0,a_{1}+\eta)$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}>a_{2}-a_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}^{\eta}=[0,a_{1}-\eta)$
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 In general, 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}^{\eta}=[b_{i-1},b_{i})$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i-1}=a_{i-1}+\eta$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}-a_{i-1}>a_{i-1}-a_{i-2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{i-1}=a_{i-1}-\eta$
\end_inset

 otherwise.
 The point is that 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{a,\eta}$
\end_inset

 lies below 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{a+\overline{\eta}}$
\end_inset

 for any vector of deviations 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{\eta}$
\end_inset

 pointwise bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}(P)$
\end_inset

-distance between 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{a,\eta}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{a,\eta}$
\end_inset

 is bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula $4\eta(k+1)\log(\delta^{-1})$
\end_inset

 by the same argument as above.
 We need 
\begin_inset Formula $O(\eta^{-k+1})$
\end_inset

 such brackets.
 We can partition 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2\eta}$
\end_inset

 sets of length 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ [0,2\eta),[2\eta,4\eta),...\right\} $
\end_inset

 where each tuple of midpoints 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1},...\alpha_{k}$
\end_inset

 covers every 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{a}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\alpha_{1}+\xi_{1},...\alpha_{k}+\xi_{k}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{i}<\eta$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{[]}(\epsilon,\mathcal{F},L_{1}(P))\leq K\epsilon^{-k+1}$
\end_inset

, for some 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$

\end_inset

-distance between 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{a,\eta}$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{a,\eta}$
\end_inset

 is bounded above by 
\begin_inset Formula $K\eta^{2}$
\end_inset

 for some

, hence they are clearly bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula $K'\eta$
\end_inset

 for some

\end_inset

 as well.
 We claim without proof that this construction can be extended to the other
 two types of histograms.
 The choice of a

\emph on

 instead.
 A good choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is of paramount importance in practice, as it avoids the

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\log N_{[]}(\epsilon,\mathcal{F},L_{2}(P))=0$
\end_inset

 when

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

 From this we can conclude that the histograms are 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}_{\delta}=\left\{ m_{(a,w)}-m_{(a_{0},w_{0})}\mid d((a,w),(a^{0},w^{0}))\leq\delta\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{F}$

 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 We define an envelope

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i}=[a_{i}\pm\delta,a_{i-1}\pm\delta)$
\end_inset

 and the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$

 is chosen so that 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{\delta}(x)$
\end_inset

 is maximised for each

 By reasoning similar to that used above, it is clear that the local bracketing

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Standard
Now we're ready for a result that does several things: It describes the
 shape of the limiting Gaussian process in the rate theorem, and establishes
 the uniformity condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 and Gaussian condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 involved in said theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{(a,w)}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}1_{I_{i}}(x)$
\end_inset

 be the objective associated with the 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

 histogram with either variable or constant weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Denote the least false vectors by 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $w$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 be the density of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

.
 Provided the conditions (A1-A5) are satisfied, the following is true
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\lim_{\delta\searrow0}\frac{P\left(m_{(a,w)+\delta(g,g')}-m_{(a,w)+\delta(h,h')}\right)^{2}}{\delta} & = & \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}f(q_{i}^{0})|g_{i}-h_{i}|\beta_{i}^{2},
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Theorem
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\beta_{i}=\log\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}-\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}.
\]

\end_inset

Thus condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Uniformity condition"

\end_inset

 is satisfied for 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi(\delta)=\sqrt{\delta}$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, condition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Gaussian condition"

\end_inset

is satisfied with 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
G(h)=\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}f(a_{i})^{\frac{1}{2}}\left|\log\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}-\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right|W_{i}(h_{i})\label{eq:Gaussian process (irregular histogram)}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $W_{i}$
\end_inset

 are independent standard Brownian motions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
First we extend, for convenience's sake, 
\begin_inset Formula $h,g$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{0},h_{k},g_{0},h_{k}=0$
\end_inset

.
 To calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\delta\searrow0}\frac{1}{\delta}\mathbb{P}\left(m_{(a^{0},w^{0})+\delta(h,h')}-m_{(a^{0},w^{0})+\delta(g,g')}\right)^{2}$
\end_inset

 we will find 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{1}{\delta}P\left[m_{(a^{0},w^{0})+\delta(h,h')}m_{(a^{0},w^{0})+\delta(g,g')}\right]
\]

\end_inset

 first, making use of the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is arbitrarily small.
 We define two handy elements, namely 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
S_{i}^{f}(\delta)=[a_{i-1}+\delta f_{i-1},a_{i}+\delta f_{i}),
\]

\end_inset

which is the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta f$
\end_inset

-extended version of 
\begin_inset Formula $[a_{i-1},a_{i})$
\end_inset

, and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
C_{i}^{f}(\delta) & = & \log(w_{i}+\delta f'_{i})-\log((a_{i}+\delta f_{i})-(a_{i-1}-\delta f_{i-1}))\nonumber \\
 & \approx & \log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}+\frac{\delta f'{}_{i}}{w_{i}}-\frac{\delta(f_{i}-f_{i-1})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}},\label{eq:C(f,j,delta)}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta(f,f')$
\end_inset

-extended variant of 
\begin_inset Formula $(\log w_{i}-\log a_{i}-a_{i-1})$
\end_inset

.
 Here the approximation follows from a first order Taylor expansion and
 the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is small.
 Then we have
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & P\left[m_{(a^{0},w^{0})+\delta(h,h')}m_{(a^{0},w^{0})+\delta(g,g')}\right]\\
 & = & \sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{k}C_{i}^{h}(\delta)C_{j}^{g}(\delta)P(S_{i}^{h}(\delta)\cap S_{j}^{g}(\delta)),
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

by the definitions of the
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

s and 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

s, for any choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $g,h$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We first consider the case 
\begin_inset Formula $g\neq h$
\end_inset

.
 Note that when 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is small enough 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}^{g}(\delta)\cap S_{j}^{h}(\delta)=\emptyset$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j$
\end_inset

 except 
\begin_inset Formula $i=j$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $i=j+1,j=i+1$
\end_inset

.
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{i}^{h}(\delta)\cap S_{j}^{h}(\delta)=S_{i}^{g}(\delta)\cap S_{j}^{g}(\delta)=\emptyset$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq j$
\end_inset

.
 Using this fact, we calculate the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{P}\left[m_{(a,w)+\delta(h,h')}m_{(a,w)+\delta(g,g')}\right]=A_{1}+A_{2}+A_{3}$
\end_inset

, where 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
A_{1} & = & \frac{1}{\delta}\sum_{i=1}^{k}C_{i+1}^{g}(\delta)C_{i}^{h}(\delta)P(S_{i+1}^{g}(\delta)\cap S_{i}^{h}(\delta)),\\
A_{2} & = & \frac{1}{\delta}\sum_{i=1}^{k}C_{i}^{g}(\delta)C_{i+1}^{h}(\delta)P(S_{i}^{g}(\delta)\cap S_{i+1}^{h}(\delta)),\\
A_{3} & = & \frac{1}{\delta}\sum_{i=1}^{k}C_{i}^{g}(\delta)C_{i}^{h}(\delta)P(S_{i}^{g}(\delta)\cap S_{i}^{h}(\delta)).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The probabilities in the first sum are easily found to be 
\begin_inset Formula $P[a_{i}+\delta g_{i},a_{i}+\delta h_{i})=f(a_{i})\delta(h_{i}-g_{i})$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}\geq g_{i}$
\end_inset

, or 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}<g_{i}$
\end_inset

, while for the second sum we get 
\begin_inset Formula $f(a_{i})\delta(g{}_{i}-h_{i})$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{i}\leq g_{i}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $g_{i}<h_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Since these conditions can't be true at the same time, we combine the sums,
 use 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:C(f,j,delta)"

\end_inset

, and pass 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta\to0$
\end_inset

 to get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\lim_{\delta\searrow0}\frac{1}{\delta}(A_{1}+A_{2})=\sum_{i=1}^{k}f(a_{i})\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\log\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}|h_{i}-g_{i}|.\label{eq:Cross terms}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Similarly, the third sum is found to be 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
A_{3} & =\sum_{i=1}^{k}[C_{i}^{f}(\delta)C_{i}^{g}(\delta)(P([a_{i-1},a_{i}))\\
 & +\delta\left[f(a_{i})\min(g_{i},h_{i})-f(a_{i-1})\max(g_{i-1},h_{i-1})\right])].
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Now we consider the case when 
\begin_inset Formula $h=g$
\end_inset

.
 In this case the cross terms corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

 equals 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and we're left with the natural analogues of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{3}$
\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
A_{4} & = & \sum C_{i}^{g}(\delta)C_{i}^{g}(\delta)(P([a_{i-1},a_{i}))+\delta\left[f(a_{i})g_{i}-f(a_{i-1})g_{i-1}\right]),\\
A_{5} & = & \sum C_{i}^{h}(\delta)C_{i}^{h}(\delta)(P([a_{i-1},a_{i}))+\delta\left[f(a_{i})h_{i}-f(a_{i-1})h_{i-1}\right]).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}^{g}(\delta)C_{i}^{h}(\delta)=\left(\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)^{2}+O(\delta)$
\end_inset

, for any 
\begin_inset Formula $h,g$
\end_inset

.
 Also, 
\begin_inset Formula $x+y-2\min(x,y)=2\max(x,y)-x-y=|x-y|$
\end_inset

, which can be applied on the sum 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\left[f(a_{i})g_{i}-f(a_{i-1})g_{i-1}\right]+\left[f(a_{i})h_{i}-f(a_{i-1})h_{i-1}\right]\\
-2\left[f(a_{i})\min(g_{i},h_{i})-f(a_{i-1})\max(g_{i-1},h_{i-1})\right]
\end{align*}

\end_inset

for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to get 
\begin_inset Formula $|h_{i}-g_{i}|f(a_{i})+|h_{i-1}-g_{i-1}|f(a_{i-1})$
\end_inset

, which we denote 
\begin_inset Formula $K_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The other term to the left in 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{3},A_{4},A_{5}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $P([a_{i-1},a_{i}))$
\end_inset

; when these terms are multiplied with the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)^{2}$
\end_inset

, they cancel each other out.
 Furthermore, the terms 
\begin_inset Formula $O(\delta)$
\end_inset

 terms in 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{i}^{g}(\delta)C_{i}^{h}(\delta)+C_{i}^{h}(\delta)C_{i}^{h}(\delta)+C_{i}^{g}(\delta)C_{i}^{g}(\delta)$
\end_inset

 also cancel each other, and we're left with only 
\begin_inset Formula $O(\delta^{2})$
\end_inset

 terms, which will get sent off to zero.
 Hence we get
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
 &  & \lim_{\delta\searrow0}\frac{1}{\delta}\left[A_{4}+A_{5}-2A_{3})\right]\nonumber \\
 & = & \lim_{\delta\searrow0}\left(\frac{1}{\delta}\sum_{i=1}^{k}[\left(\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)^{2}+O(\delta)]\delta K_{i}\right)\label{eq:Key part (sqrt convergence)}\\
 & = & \sum_{i=1}^{k}K_{i}\left(\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)^{2}\nonumber \\
 & = & \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}|h_{i}-g_{i}|f(a_{i})\left(\left(\log\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)^{2}\right).\nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Now we take the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\delta\searrow0}\frac{1}{\delta}\left[A_{4}+A_{5}-2A_{3})\right]-\lim_{\delta\searrow0}\frac{1}{\delta}2(A_{1}+A_{2})$
\end_inset

, which equals
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}f(a_{i})|g_{i}-h_{i}|\left(\log\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}-\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)^{2}.
\]

\end_inset

It remains to show that this corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $E(G(h)-G(g))^{2}$
\end_inset

 for the Gaussian process described above.
 Its covariance kernel is given by
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\min(g_{i},h_{i})f(a_{i})\left(\log\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}-\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)^{2},
\]

\end_inset

by the property of Brownian motions that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Cov}(B(t),B(s))=\sigma^{2}\min(t,s)$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 is a Brownian motion such that 
\begin_inset Formula $B(t)$
\end_inset

 has variance 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 From this it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
E(G(h)-G(g))^{2} & = & \Var G(h)+\Var G(g)-2\Cov(G(g),G(h))\\
 & = & \sum_{i=1}^{k}f(a_{i})\left|\beta\right|(h_{i}+g_{i}-2\min(h_{i},g_{i}))\\
 & = & \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}f(a_{i})\beta^{2}|h_{i}-g_{i}|.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $h'$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g'$
\end_inset

, the free variables corresponding the weights 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

, play no active role in the proof.
 Their role in the limit distribution is solely confined to the Hessian
 or information matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, considered in the next theorem.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Remark
Notice the role of A5: It makes sure that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}f(q_{i}^{0})|g_{i}-h_{i}|\left(\log\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}-\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)^{2}
\]

\end_inset

is non-zero for every choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

.
 Assumption A4 is clearly necessary, as we can see in this example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example

 (On assumption A4).
 Consider the case of

\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

.
 These distributions are symmetric, are unimodal whenever

 and have two 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Not surprisingly, there are two best approximating histograms when 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha<1$
\end_inset

 is sufficiently close to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 For instance, when

\begin_inset Formula $a\approx0.99995$
\end_inset

 and one in

\end_inset

 As can be seen in the Figure

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
V_{k-1,2k-2} & = & \frac{f(a_{i})}{w_{i}}+\frac{f(a_{k-1})}{w_{k}},\\
V_{k-2,2k-2} & = & \frac{f(a_{i-1})}{w_{i}}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Here the conventions 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}=1$
\end_inset

 are used.
 All the other elements are 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
For the elements only involving the split points, observe that the only
 part of the sum involving 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
v & =\left[F(a_{i})-F(a_{i-1})\right](\log w_{i}-\log\left(a_{i}-a_{i-1}\right))\\
 & +\left[F(a_{i+1})-F(a_{i})\right](\log w_{i+1}-\log\left(a_{i+1}-a_{i}\right)).
\end{align*}

\end_inset

Differentiation gives us
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dv}{da_{i}} & = & f(a_{i})\left(\log w_{i}-\log\left(a_{i}-a_{i-1}\right)\right)-\frac{\left[F(a_{i})-F(a_{i-1})\right]}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\\
 &  & -f(a_{i})\left(\log w_{i+1}-\log\left(a_{i+1}-a_{i}\right)\right)+\frac{\left[F(a_{i+1})-F(a_{i})\right]}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Hence
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dv}{da_{i}a_{i+1}} & = & \frac{f(a_{i})+f(a_{i+1})}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}-\frac{\left[F(a_{i+1})-F(a_{i})\right]}{\left(a_{i+1}-a_{i}\right)^{2}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

while
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dv}{da_{i}da_{i}} & = & f'(a_{i})(\log w_{i}-\log w_{i+1}-\log(a_{i}-a_{i-1})+\log\left(a_{i+1}-a_{i}\right))\\
 &  & -2f(a_{i})\left(\frac{1}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}+\frac{1}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right),\\
 &  & +\frac{\left[F(a_{i+1})-F(a_{i})\right]}{\left(a_{i+1}-a_{i}\right)^{2}}+\frac{\left[F(a_{i})-F(a_{i-1})\right]}{\left(a_{i}-a_{i-1}\right)^{2}}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Concerning 
\begin_inset Formula $i'$
\end_inset

, recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{k}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}$
\end_inset

, and that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{k}$
\end_inset

 only appears in 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[1-F(a_{k-1})\right](\log w_{k}-\log\left(1-a_{k-1}\right)).
\]

\end_inset

This means that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$
\end_inset

 also cares about the contribution it gives to the last box, an issue not
 faced by the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

s.
 it is clear that all elements involving 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

' are 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 except
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d}{dw_{i}dw_{i}}=-\left(\frac{1}{F(a_{i})-F(a_{i-1})}+\frac{1}{1-F(a_{k-1})}\right),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{1-F(a_{k-1})}$
\end_inset

 appears due to the additional contribution from 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Also, when 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq k-1,$
\end_inset

 we have 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{d}{dw_{i}da_{i}} & = & \frac{f(a_{i})}{w_{i}},\\
\frac{d}{dw_{i}da_{i-1}} & = & \frac{f(a_{i-1})}{w_{i}},\\
\frac{d}{dw_{i}da_{k-1}} & = & \frac{f(a_{k-1})}{w_{k}}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

For 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq k-1$
\end_inset

, and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\frac{d}{dw_{i}da_{i}}=\frac{f(a_{i})}{w_{i}}+\frac{f(a_{i})}{1-w_{i}},
\]

\end_inset

when 
\begin_inset Formula $i=k-1.$

Combining these two results with the rate theorem, we get this thesis' main
 result: The limiting distribution of the irregular Kullback-Leibler histogram
 with variable and constant weights.
 Looking at the rate theorem, the only conditions left are those concerning
 a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

suitable envelope 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{\delta}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, namely the Lindeberg condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\lim_{\delta\searrow0}\frac{P^{\star}M_{\delta}^{2}\{M_{\delta}>\eta\delta^{-2}\phi^{2}(\delta)\}}{\phi^{2}(\delta)}=0$
\end_inset

 together with the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{2}(\delta)\geq P^{\star}M_{\delta}^{2}$
\end_inset

, which we ignore.
 Both of these can probably be shown by using similar calculations as in
 Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "thm:Covariance structure, KL"

\end_inset

, but this would be laborious and not very enlightening.
 We assume these two conditions are satisfied in the following.

 converges in distribution to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}h^{T}Vh+G(h)$

\]

\end_inset

with 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}=P([a_{i-1},a_{i}))$
\end_inset

 in the case of variable weights, and the predefined 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{i}$

 otherwise, and

 are given in Proposition

We begin by studying the simplest case of 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 and constant weights; in this case there is only a single true 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 From Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:Matrix elements of histogram distribution"

\end_inset

 we find that 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
V=f'(a)(\log(1-a)-\log a)-2f(a)\left(\frac{1}{1-a}+\frac{1}{a}\right)+\frac{1-F(a)}{(1-a)^{2}}+\frac{F(a)}{a^{2}},
\]

\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $G(h)=f(a)^{\frac{1}{2}}\left|\log a-\log(1-a)\right|W(h)=dW(h)$
\end_inset

, and the limiting distribution is 
\begin_inset Formula $\argmax_{h}\frac{1}{2}Vh^{2}+G(h)$
\end_inset

.
 Using Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:Chernoff trick"

\end_inset

 from the section on Chernoff's mode estimator, we find the equivalent formulati
on 
\begin_inset Formula $|\frac{2d}{V}|{}^{-\frac{2}{3}}Z$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=\argmax_{h}\left[W(h)-h^{2}\right]$
\end_inset

 is Chernoff's distribution.

Next we will use this result in some simulations.
 Using the results in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "p.9 - 13, table 1 and 3"
key "groeneboom2001computing"

\end_inset

, we can obtain almost exact quantiles for this distribution, allowing us
 to construct approximate confidence intervals and check how well the limit
 distribution approximates the actual distributions for different 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 However, this will not work for any choice of distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $F,$
\end_inset

 as the table in Groeneboom and Wellner doesn't contain enough values for
 the calculation of arbitrary rescalings.
 Due to this we do one large simulation of the Chernoff distribution with
 step size 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0.001$
\end_inset

 with 600 000 replications.
 Our goal is to understand how fast the finite sample distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\frac{1}{3}}(\widehat{q_{0}}-q_{0})$
\end_inset

 converges to the stated limiting distribution.

The

 between two distributions 
\begin_inset Formula $F$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $G$

 is defined by 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{K}(F,G)=\sup_{x}|F(x)-G(x)|$
\end_inset

, which corresponds to the greatest vertical distance between the two distributi
ons when they are plotted in the same window.
 We will use this function to measure the distance between simulated finite
 sample distributions and the real distribution.
 Our choices of test distributions are 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Beta}(1,\frac{1}{2})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Beta}(2,7)$
\end_inset

, which have slightly different shapes.
 For comparison's sake, we perform the same experiment with the mean of
 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1},...,X_{n}$
\end_inset

 standard log normal variables, which is understood as a case when the CLT
 is relatively slow working.
 We perform the experiment for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=50,100,500,1000,10000,100000$

 The estimator is 
\begin_inset Formula $\argmax_{h}\frac{1}{2}h^{T}Vh+dW(h_{1})$

 As in the previous example, this can can be simplified.
 Use

 and assume

 Then the maximum of

 yields 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{2}=-\frac{eh_{1}}{2c_{3}}$

\end_inset

 It follows that whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{1}$

 maximises 
\begin_inset Formula $G(h_{1})+h_{1}^{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}(c_{1}-\frac{c_{2}^{2}}{c_{3}}+\frac{c_{2}^{2}}{4c_{3}})$

 Use the Proposition

\begin_inset Formula $G(h_{1})+h_{1}^{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2}(c-\frac{c_{2}^{2}}{c_{3}}+\frac{c_{2}^{2}}{4c_{3}})$

\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 We will translate this condition into something more understandable.
 First we notice that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{w_{j}}{a_{j}-a_{j-1}}=\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 by induction.
 Now we claim that all of these are equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

If

\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}=1$
\end_inset

 for every 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
First assume 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 and recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{2}=1-w_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Again we use the convention 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k}=1$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}=\log\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}$
\end_inset

 for each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

, we have that 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{w_{1}}{a_{1}}=\frac{1-w_{1}}{1-a_{1}}$
\end_inset

.
 Solving this equation yields 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{1}=a_{1}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}=1$
\end_inset

 as claimed.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq2$
\end_inset

, we use induction.
 If it is true for 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, we consider the distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $F'=a_{k}^{-1}F(a_{k}^{-1}x)$
\end_inset

.
 The rescaled histogram associated with this distribution has weights 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{w_{i}}{a_{k}}$
\end_inset

 and splits 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{a_{i}}{a_{k}}$
\end_inset

, hence every 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{w_{i}/a_{k}}{(a_{i}-a_{i-1})/a_{k}}=\frac{w_{i}}{(a_{i}-a_{i-1})}=1$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,(k-1)$
\end_inset

 by the induction hypothesis.
 We can do this the other way around, starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}$
\end_inset

, in order to get 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{w_{k}}{a_{k}-a_{k-1}}=1$
\end_inset

 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows that Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "thm:Main theorem, Kullback-Leibler"

\end_inset

 can't be used in the case when each block in the histogram has equal probabilit
y as length.
 This can happen for instance when the underlying distribution is symmetric
 and unimodal with 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 and when the underlying distribution is uniform for any 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

 is given in Proposition

\begin_layout Proof
This is a slight modification of the proof in Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

: Instead of finding the terms involving 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\delta^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{2}$
\end_inset

, the only terms involving 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta^{2}$
\end_inset

 also involved 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\frac{w_{j}}{a_{j}-a_{j-1}}$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, but these are equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 by the previous proposition.
 Similarly, all terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{3},A_{4}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{5}$
\end_inset

 containing 
\begin_inset Formula $\log\frac{w_{j}}{a_{j}-a_{j-1}}$
\end_inset

 can be disregarded.
 This leaves the terms containing 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta^{2}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{k}P([a_{i-1},a_{i}))\left[C_{i}^{g}(\delta)C_{i}^{h}(\delta)+C_{i}^{h}(\delta)C_{i}^{h}(\delta)-2C_{i}^{g}(\delta)C_{i}^{g}(\delta)\right]$
\end_inset

:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & \sum_{i=1}^{k}P([a_{i-1},a_{i}))\left(\frac{\delta h'{}_{i}}{w_{i}}-\frac{\delta(h_{i}-h_{i-1})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)^{2}\\
 & + & \sum_{i=1}^{k}P([a_{i-1},a_{i}))\left(\frac{\delta g'{}_{i}}{w_{i}}-\frac{\delta(g_{i}-g_{i-1})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)^{2}\\
 & - & 2\sum_{i=1}^{k}P([a_{i-1},a_{i}))\left(\frac{\delta h'{}_{i}}{w_{i}}-\frac{\delta(h_{i}-h_{i-1})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)\left(\frac{\delta g'{}_{i}}{w_{i}}-\frac{\delta(g_{i}-g_{i-1})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

which clearly simplifies to
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\delta^{2}\sum_{i=1}^{k}P([a_{i-1},a_{i}))\left(\frac{h'{}_{i}-g'{}_{i}}{w_{i}}-\frac{(g_{i}-h_{i})-(g_{i-1}-h_{i-1})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)^{2}.
\]

\end_inset

The covariance kernel of the limiting Gaussian process is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
E(G(h)G(g))=\sum_{i=1}^{k}P([a_{i-1},a_{i}))\left(\frac{\delta h'{}_{i}}{w_{i}}-\frac{\delta(h_{i}-h_{i-1})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)\left(\frac{\delta g'{}_{i}}{w_{i}}-\frac{\delta(g_{i}-g_{i-1})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right).
\]

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $G(h)=h^{T}Z$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\sim N(0,\Sigma)$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 as in the statement of the theorem.
 Then it can be verified that this is the right process by calculating 
\begin_inset Formula $E(h^{T}Z(g^{T}Z))=h^{T}\Sigma g$
\end_inset

.
 We write 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma g$
\end_inset

 in the form of linear combinations of column vectors: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
h^{T}\Sigma g & = & (h_{1},...h_{k-1},h'_{1},...h'_{k-1})(\Sigma_{1}g_{1},...\Sigma_{k-1}g_{k-1},\Sigma_{k}g'_{1},...\Sigma_{2k-2}g'_{k-1})\\
 & = & \sum_{i=1}^{k}P(I_{i})\left(\frac{h'{}_{i}}{w_{i}}-\frac{(h_{i}-h_{i-1})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)\left(\frac{g'{}_{i}}{w_{i}}-\frac{(g_{i}-g_{i-1})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

To find this 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 we rewrite the sum slightly:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}g_{i}(-h_{i-1}\frac{P(I_{i})}{\left(a_{i}-a_{i-1}\right)^{2}}+h_{i}\left(\frac{P(I_{i})}{\left(a_{i}-a_{i-1}\right)^{2}}+\frac{P(I_{i+1})}{\left(a_{i+1}-a_{i}\right)^{2}}\right)\\
 &  & -h_{i+1}\frac{P(I_{i+1})}{\left(a_{i+1}-a_{i}\right)^{2}}+\frac{P(I_{i})h'_{i}}{w_{i}\left(a_{i}-a_{i-1}\right)}-\frac{P(I_{i+1})h'_{i+1}}{w_{i+1}\left(a_{i+1}-a_{i}\right)})\\
 & + & \sum_{i=1}^{k-1}g'_{i}\left[\frac{h'_{i}}{w_{i}^{2}}+\frac{P(I_{i})h_{i-1}}{w_{i}\left(a_{i-1}-a_{i}\right)}-\frac{P(I_{i})h{}_{i}}{w_{i}\left(a_{i}-a_{i-1}\right)}\right],
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{0}=g_{0}=h_{k}=g_{k}=0$
\end_inset

.
 This gives us the covariance matrix with elements described above.
 The limiting distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}(\widehat{(a,w)}-(a,w))$
\end_inset

 is the maximiser of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}h^{T}Vh+h^{T}Z$
\end_inset

.
 Differentiation with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula $Vh+Z=0$
\end_inset

, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{h}=V^{-1}Z\sim N(0,V^{-1}\Sigma V^{-1})$
\end_inset

 as claimed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "exa:Uniform distribution histogram"

\end_inset

Let 
\begin_inset Formula $F=\mathcal{U}(0,1)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq2$
\end_inset

.
 If constant weights are used, each 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}-a_{i-1}=\frac{1}{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P(I_{i})=\frac{1}{k}$
\end_inset

, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i,i-1}=\sigma_{i,i+1}=-k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i,i}=2k$
\end_inset

.
 As for 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{ii}=-2k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{i,i+1}=V_{i,i-1}=k$
\end_inset

.
 Hence the maximiser is 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{k}(0,V^{-1}\Sigma V^{-1})=N_{k}(0,V^{-1})$
\end_inset

-distributed.
 It can be shown by recursion that 
\begin_inset Formula $V_{ij}^{-1}=\frac{(k-j)i}{k^{2}}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $j\geq i$
\end_inset

.
 Recall Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:Histograms on quantiles"

\end_inset

 on the asymptotic distribution of quantiles, where it is stated that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{n}(\widehat{q}-q)\tod N(0,\Sigma)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma_{ij}=\frac{(k-j)i}{k^{2}f(q_{(i)})f(q_{(j)})}=\frac{(k-j)i}{k^{2}}$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that these two approaches are asymptotically equivalent in the
 context of the uniform distribution.
 Histograms with variable weights will not be unique in this setting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
Clearly, it would be silly to use the 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

-histogram with constant weights in order to estimate the quantiles of a
 uniform distribution.
 This is a bad idea for several reasons (of descending importance): 1.) If
 we know that the underlying distribution is in fact uniform, it would be
 far wiser and more efficient to use 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{-1},2k^{-1},...,(k-1)k^{-1}$
\end_inset

 as the quantiles.
 2.) This only works if the underlying distribution is, in fact, uniform
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1]$
\end_inset

.
 If it isn't, the split points will not converge to the quantiles.
 3.) Following the theme of slow convergence, the covariance matrix of the
 split points takes a very long time to come appreciably close to the covariance
 matrix of the quantiles.
 we will investigate this in the next example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another example is the case of a symmetric distributions for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

.
 We tacitly assume the existence of a unique, well-separated maximum, hence
 
\begin_inset Formula $a=0.5$
\end_inset

 by symmetry.
 The maximum is typically not unique when we use variable weight histograms,
 hence we use constant weight histograms in the next example.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "exa:Unimodal symmetric distributions"

\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

, the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Sigma$
\end_inset

 simplifies to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1/2}{(1/2)^{2}}+\frac{1/2}{(1/2)^{2}}=4$
\end_inset

, hence the asymptotic variance is 
\begin_inset Formula $4V^{-2}=\frac{1}{4}(2f(0.5)-1)^{-2}$
\end_inset

.

\end_inset

, the convergence (to 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5$

 larger than this for finite sample sizes.
 The decay of the ratio between the empirical and limiting variance appears
 to be of the form

 on the actual argmax, but might be considered if one wants the limiting

\begin_layout Standard
Many, if not most, optimisation problems in statistics can be solved by
 numerical packages tailored toward solving problems with smooth objective
 functions.
 The prototypical example is using Newton-Raphson to solve the maximum likelihoo
d problem for a gamma distributed random variable.
 Using such procedures works very well, provided the objective function
 is sufficiently smooth and concave.
 In the case of irregular histograms, we have neither --- our objective
 function has many local maxima and has jump discontinuities all over the
 place.
 Instead, we need combinatorial optimisation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We describe three algorithms: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
An exact algorithm based on 
\emph on
dynamic programming
\emph default
 (see e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
after "chap. 10"
key "weiss1998data"

\end_inset

).
 This is essentially the same as the algorithm described in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "rozenholc2010combining"

\end_inset

 (first in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kanazawa1988optimal"

\end_inset

).
 Our new contribution is to solve the problem for all combinations of Kullback-L
eibler, 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

, and variable or equal weights, while 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeauthor
key "rozenholc2010combining"

\end_inset

 only considered Kullback-Leibler irregular histograms with variable weights.
 Unfortunately, this algorithm runs in approximately quadratic time, namely
 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{2}k)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
A coordinate search algorithm.
 This usually runs linearly in 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, and has worst case complexity bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n\log n)$
\end_inset

 in our implementation.
 This is an approximation algorithm, but simulation studies indicate that
 its performance is satisfactory, which leads us to recommend it above the
 dynamic programming algorithm.
 When pre-smoothing, bootstrapping or running simulation studies, the gain
 in processing time is significant.
 Unfortunately, it doesn't perform well for the CIC of Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_layout Enumerate

 for different choices of histogram methods.
 Recall that the objective function for the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-histogram is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}\frac{(2P(a_{i-1},a_{i})-w_{i})}{a_{i-1}-a_{i}}$
\end_inset

.
 We remove a redundant 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{-1}$

\begin_inset Formula $2P(a_{i-1},a_{i})-w_{i}=P(a_{i-1},a_{i})$
\end_inset

 for the variable weights.

\begin_layout Proposition
For any irregular histogram, the solution set is a subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}\}$
\end_inset

, provided the probabilities 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}[x_{j},x_{i})$
\end_inset

 involved in the sum are substituted with 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}[x_{j}.x_{i}]$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},...,a_{k-1}$
\end_inset

 are the solutions, and put 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}=0,a_{k}=1$
\end_inset

 .
 Choose a 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, and notice that the only part of the objective function that depends on
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
R(a_{j-1},a_{j})+R(a_{j},a_{j+1}),
\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

 is chosen from table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Histogram weights"

\end_inset

 of histogram weights.
 Hence it suffices to show that this is maximised for an 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{l}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{u}$
\end_inset

 be the greatest lower bound and least upper bound of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}\}$
\end_inset

, respectively, so we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}\in[x_{l},x_{u}]$
\end_inset

.
 Assume 
\begin_inset Formula $R(x_{j},x_{i})=\log\frac{P_{n}[x_{j},x_{i})}{x_{i}-x_{j}}P_{n}[x_{j},x_{i})]$
\end_inset

 for concreteness, and notice that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
 &  & R(a_{j-1},a_{j})+R(a_{j},a_{j+1})\\
 & = & P_{n}[a_{j-1},x_{l}]\log\frac{P_{n}[a_{j-1},x_{l}]}{a_{j}-a_{j-1}}+P_{n}[x_{u},a_{j+1}]\log\frac{P_{n}[x_{u},a_{j+1}]}{a_{j+1}-a_{j}},
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

hence we reduce the problem to the maximisation of 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
g(a_{j})=-p_{1}\log(a_{j}-a_{j-1})-p_{2}\log(a_{j+1}-a_{j}),\label{eq:Modified R}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}=P_{n}[a_{j-1},x_{l}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}=P_{n}[x_{u},a_{j+1}]$
\end_inset

.
 For simplicity, extend the candidate solution set to 
\begin_inset Formula $[x_{l},x_{u}]$
\end_inset

.
 By differentiating 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 twice we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $g''(a_{j})=\frac{p_{1}}{(a_{j}-a_{j-1})^{2}}+\frac{p_{2}}{(a_{j+1}-a_{j})^{2}}>0$
\end_inset

, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 is strictly convex, and it attains its maximum on either 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{l}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{u}$
\end_inset

.
 For the other choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

, the argument is similar: Differentiate twice in order to find that the
 
\begin_inset Formula $R$
\end_inset

-analogue of the modified function in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:Modified R"

\end_inset

 is strictly convex.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proposition would not be true if we were to use 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}[x_{j},x_{i})$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}(x_{j},x_{i}]$
\end_inset

 in our table, as that would make it possible for the objective function
 to jump down at the boundary.
 In this case, the maximum would either fail to exist (get bigger and bigger
 the closer it gets to 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{u}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{l}$
\end_inset

) or be the 
\begin_inset Formula $x\in\{x_{u},x_{l}\}$
\end_inset

 which we thought of as sub maximal in the previous proposition.
 Either way, it makes sense to search the observations for a maximiser in
 these cases as well.
 Since all these options are asymptotically equivalent and don't make much
 of a difference in practice, we will restrict our search of optima to the
 data points.

\begin_layout Standard
The weights will depend on which histogram we want to construct, with values
 in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Histogram weights"

\end_inset

, where the weight assigned to the edge between 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $R(x_{i},x_{j})$
\end_inset

.
 The following observations is the key to make everything work: A path through
 the graph, visiting nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $0,x_{i_{1}},x_{i_{2}},...,x_{i_{k}},1$
\end_inset

, will have value 
\begin_inset Formula $R(0,x_{i_{1}})+R(x_{i_{k}},1)+\sum_{j=1}^{k}R(x_{i_{j}},x_{i_{j+1}})$
\end_inset

, which is the objective function corresponding to the choice of type/weights
 of the histogram.
 This form of decomposition shows that the problems has an 
\emph on
optimal substructure
\emph default
 , which allows us to do a sequential enumeration of all solutions.
 In order to compute the objective functions, we use double recursion: For
 each node we wish to calculate the value 
\begin_inset Formula $V(x_{j}^{i})=R(0,x_{i_{1}})+\sum_{l=1}^{i}R(x_{i_{l}},x_{i_{l+1}})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 designates the level of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be done by applying the recursive formula 
\begin_inset Formula $V(x_{j}^{i})=\max_{l<j}V(x_{l}^{i-1})+R(x_{i_{l}},x_{i_{j}})$
\end_inset

, where we store the value 
\begin_inset Formula $V(x_{j}^{i})$
\end_inset

 at the 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,j)$
\end_inset

th node.
 When the algorithm terminates at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=1$
\end_inset

, we output the path 
\begin_inset Formula $0\to x_{i_{1}}\to x_{i_{2}}\to...\to1$
\end_inset

 which lead to the maximised value.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
The DP algorithm runs in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(kn^{2})$
\end_inset

 time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
The weighted digraph 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

 will have 
\begin_inset Formula $2+k(n-k+1)=O(kn)$
\end_inset

 vertices and 
\begin_inset Formula $2(n-k+1)+(k-1)\frac{(n-k+1)(n-k+2)}{2}=O(kn^{2})$
\end_inset

 edges.
 Since the algorithm just described will visit each edge exactly once, the
 algorithm will run in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(kn^{2})$
\end_inset

 time provided the graph has been constructed.
 Constructing the graph can be done in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(kn^{2})$
\end_inset

 time, as it takes constant time to add a vertex or an edge with all our
 edge weights 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Even though this algorithm is described using graph theoretic language and
 intuition, the implementation of this algorithm does not rely on graph
 theoretic data structures of any kind.
 The graph theoretic description of this algorithm was chosen as it clearly
 illustrates how the algorithm works and points toward some ideas for making
 it run faster.
 It could be possible to remove sections of non-trivial size from the graph
 before checking them, and there are at least two possible ways to go about
 this.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Use upper and lower bounds on the objective in certain sections of the graph.
 One could implement this by assigning to each vertex 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}^{i}$
\end_inset

 a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $l(x_{j}^{i})$
\end_inset

 and upper bound 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x_{j}^{i})$
\end_inset

, and disregard any edge emanating from that vertex whenever its upper bound
 is lower than the current global lower bound 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

.
 A naïve choice of lower and upper bounds would be to make 
\begin_inset Formula $l(x_{j}^{i})$
\end_inset

 a random path in the diagram containing 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}^{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u(x_{j}^{i})=V(x_{j}^{i})+h(x_{j}^{i})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $h(x_{j}^{i})=\sum_{i\in C}R(x_{i},x_{i+1})$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\{j,j+1,...,n\}$
\end_inset

.
 This upper bound will typically be far too large, however.
 An issue with the upper bound is that there is no theoretical upper bound
 on 
\begin_inset Formula $h'(x_{j}^{i})=\sum_{i=j+1}^{k}R(y_{i-1},y_{i})$
\end_inset

 which holds for any underlying distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

: By creating an arbitrarily sharp spike in the density, this value can
 become arbitrarily large.
 A workaround is to impose upper bounds that aren't theoretically sound,
 but might still works well in practice: For instance, we could use bounds
 obtained from distributions which we have reason to think that behaves
 worse than the true 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Prune the graph by throwing away 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}^{i}$
\end_inset

s we consider unlikely to be in the solution path.
 For instance, it seems very unlikely that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{n-k}^{1}$
\end_inset

 is the first element of the solution path.
 One could implement this idea by removing quantiles from each level of
 the graph, e.g.
 the lower quartile for the first level and upper quartile on the last level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These lines of thinking will not be pursued further, but might be worth
 it if we're serious about using the CIC in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "sec:Information-criteria"

\end_inset

.
 Here massive resampling has to be carried out, and the coordinate search
 soon to be described will not do the job properly.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The complexity 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{2}k)$
\end_inset

 means that the algorithm runs in exponential time, at least on the face
 of it.
 This is because 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is not
\emph on
 
\emph default
the 
\emph on
input length
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, the input length of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\log_{2}k$
\end_inset

.
 This is not the case with the data points 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},...,x_{n}$
\end_inset

, which have input size 
\begin_inset Formula $cn$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 Obviously, whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is considered as a fixed parameter, the algorithm runs in quadratic time
 and should be considered fast.
 However, if 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is not considered fixed, it runs in 
\emph on
pseudo-polynomial time, 
\emph default
the class of algorithms which runs in polynomial time as function of input
 value, not input length 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 203"
key "papadimitriou2003computational"

\end_inset

.
 In our case, since 
\begin_inset Formula $2\leq k<n$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 typically much less than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the algorithm has complexity bounded by 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n^{3})$
\end_inset

, cubic time.
 This phenomenon is not dissimilar to the dynamic programming algorithm
 for the 
\emph on
knapsack problem
\emph default
, a problem that is known to be 
\begin_inset Formula $NP$
\end_inset

-complete in its decision problem formulation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "p. 202"
key "papadimitriou2003computational"

\end_inset

.
 Whenever a certain 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is polynomially bounded in the input 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, it is solvable in polynomial time; if not, it runs in exponential time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While this algorithm yields exact estimates in a reasonable time, the resulting
 estimates will not be 
\emph on
robust 
\emph default
in the sense that they can be very sensitive to slight changes in input
 values.
 We will discuss this issue further in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Presmoothing-and-instability"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, in our 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{C++}$
\end_inset

 program (of Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "chap:Histogram"

\end_inset

) the difference in run times between the 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 histograms is very large.
 The choice of constant or variable weights doesn't seem to matter.
 This came as a big surprise, and the culprit has to be the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{log}$
\end_inset

s involved in the 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

-maximisation.
 Now we use the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{R}$
\end_inset

 package 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{microbenchmark}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "microbenchmark"

\end_inset

 to time how much faster 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 is.
 We replicate 
\begin_inset Formula $N=500$
\end_inset

 histograms of both types for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2,3,...,80$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n=500$
\end_inset

.
 In addition, we use a modification of the algorithm into a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

skeleton
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, such that only the constructions that both histograms have in common are
 computed.
 Denote the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 times by 
\begin_inset Formula $T(L_{2})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

 runtimes by 
\begin_inset Formula $T(KL)$
\end_inset

 and the skeleton runtimes by 
\begin_inset Formula $T(S)$
\end_inset

.
 Now we look at 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{T(KL)-T(S)}{T(L_{2})-T(S)}$
\end_inset

, which is seen to be about 
\begin_inset Formula $16$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 This gives a reasonable estimate on how much faster 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 is.
 This difference in execution time is a large point in favour of 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

, especially if one wishes to do the subsampling approach to the CIC in
 Section

\begin_layout Standard
We describe a 
\emph on
coordinate search
\emph default
 approximation algorithm, a type of local search algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

after "section 3.6"
key "hromkovivc2013algorithmics"

\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 be fixed and define an initial vector 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{0}=(a_{1}^{0},\ldots,a_{k}^{0})$
\end_inset

.
 Put 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{k+1}=1$
\end_inset

, and define recursively
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a_{i}^{j}=\argmax_{a_{i-1}^{j}<p<a_{i+1}^{j-1}}R(a_{i-1}^{j},p)+R(p,a_{i+1}^{j-1}).
\]

\end_inset

On ties, choose the smallest possible 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 We say that the algorithm terminates in iteration 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}^{j}=a_{i}^{j+1}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
The coordinate search algorithm terminates.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Notice that the objective function can only increase in value when 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}^{j}$
\end_inset

 is swapped for 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}^{j+1}$
\end_inset

.
 Now suppose the algorithm doesn't terminate.
 Since there are finitely many states, it has to by cyclic.
 But this is impossible, as it would either lead to decreasing values of
 the objective function for at least one 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}^{j}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}^{j+1}$
\end_inset

, or make the objective function constant.
 However, an 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}^{j}$
\end_inset

 can't change more than once when the objective function doesn't increase,
 due to the tie-breaking rule.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This algorithm yields consistent estimates.
 Heuristically, this can be seen as follows: For each 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 it finds the maximum in the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th dimension.
 It converges to a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

local
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 maximum in the sense that it can't move along any 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-direction without diminishing in value.
 Now, whenever the underlying function is concave, this can only happen
 when it is at an actual maximum.
 Since the likelihood converges in distribution towards a concave function,
 it is consistent.
 Hence we expect the results of this algorithm to have the same asymptotic
 properties as the exact algorithm, as the rate theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "thm:rate theorem"

\end_inset

 only requires 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}m_{\widehat{\theta}_{n}}\geq\argmax_{\theta}P_{n}m_{\theta}-o_{p}(1)$
\end_inset

, a condition which is probably satisfied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In our implementation, we will add an upper bound to the number of full
 iterations.
 We will let this be a used defined 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

.
 With this modification, at worst this algorithm will terminate after 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 full iterations.
 Since each full iteration will check at most 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 points, it is complexity is bounded, very roughly, by 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n\log n)$
\end_inset

.
 This is an order of magnitude faster than the exact algorithm, and doesn't
 depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 (It is 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n\log n)$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n)$
\end_inset

 since we need to sort the list of observations first.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This algorithm requires an initial input to run on.
 We have not studied the effects of initial input thoroughly, but it certainly
 matters.
 In all our uses of the coordinate search algorithm we use an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

evenly spaced
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 initial input, namely the vector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{i}{k}$
\end_inset

th quantiles, with 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 ranging from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

.
 This choice is clearly justifiable in the context of irregular quantile
 histograms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Integer programming
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As was the case for Manski's estimator (Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Algorithms-and-complexity"

\end_inset

), we can formulate the histogram problem as a mixed integer program.
 We wish to maximise the linear objective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i,j}z_{ij}w(i,j),\label{eq:Histogram integer programming objective}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $w(i,j)=W(x_{i},x_{j})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 is chosen from table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Histogram weights"

\end_inset

.
 This objective should satisfy the constraints
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\sum_{j=1}^{n-k+1}z_{1i} & = & 1,\\
\sum_{j=n-k+1}^{n}z_{i(n+1)} & = & 1,\\
\sum_{j=1}^{n}z_{ij} & \leq & 1,\quad\forall i=1,...,n,\\
\\
\sum z_{ij} & = & k+2,\\
\sum_{i<j<k}z_{ij}z_{jk} & = & k+2,\\
z_{ij} & \in & \{0,1\}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

While the last constraint is not linear, it can be reformulated as a linear
 constraint, basically because 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ij}z_{jk}$
\end_inset

 can be understood as 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ij}\wedge z_{jk}$
\end_inset

.
 The method is as follows: Define a set of new variables 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{ijk}$
\end_inset

, add the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i<j<k}w_{ijk}=k+2$
\end_inset

 and add, for every suitable 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j,k$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
w_{ijk} & \leq & z_{ij},\\
w_{ijk} & \leq & z_{jk},\\
w_{ijk} & \geq & z_{ij}+z_{jk}-1.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Why these constraints? The first forces there to be exactly one edge connecting
 the source to the body of the graph, while the second assures us that there
 is exactly one edge connecting the sink to the body of the graph.
 The following constraint force every 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to appear at most once, while the constraint 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum z_{ij}=k+2$
\end_inset

 says how many edges we want to include.
 In order to ascertain that the 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ij}$
\end_inset

 describe a connected path of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 vertices in the graph, we require the multiplicative constraint.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally we mention the approximation algorithm of choice for 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "histogram"

\end_inset

, used in the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{R}$
\end_inset

 package 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{histogram}.$
\end_inset

 This is a greedy algorithm.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $k>2$
\end_inset

 be a given bin count.
 The algorithm starts by performing an inexpensive 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 histogram calculation.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $k=i$
\end_inset

 bins are calculated, it finds the 
\begin_inset Formula $(i+1)$
\end_inset

th split point by minimizing the divergence in each bin separately, choosing
 the split point which maximises the global reduction of divergence.

\begin_layout Standard
When estimating our histograms, we minimise the 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta\mapsto P_{n}m_{\theta}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}$
\end_inset

 is the empirical measure.
 However, since we assume some smoothness in the true distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, it should also work to use a smoothed variant 
\begin_inset Formula $\widetilde{P}_{n}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, such as the Gaussian copula estimator.
 Here we demonstrate that this is the case, and also discuss some advantages
 of this approach.
 First we discuss a very important anomaly of the irregular histograms.

\begin_layout Subsection
Instability

\begin_layout Standard
Recall the general histogram formula

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

\end_inset

where the 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}$
\end_inset

s are constrained to be inside the set of observations 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},...,x_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(i)}$
\end_inset

 denote the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

th order statistic.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}[x_{(i)},x_{(i+j)})^{2}=\frac{4+(j-1)^{2}}{n^{2}}.$
\end_inset

 When 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is small, this quantity is also small, 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}[x_{(i)},x_{(i+j)}]^{2}\approx n^{-2}$
\end_inset

.
 But it might also happen that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(i+j)}-x_{(i)}$
\end_inset

 is very small: In this case 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(i+1)}-x_{(i)},x_{(i+2)}-x_{(i+1)}$
\end_inset

 etc.
 will be even smaller.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(i+1)}-x_{(i)}\lll\frac{1}{n^{2}}$
\end_inset

, the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{P_{n}[x_{(i)},x_{(i+1)})}{x_{(i+1)}-x_{(i)}}P_{n}[x_{j},x_{i})=\frac{4}{n^{2}\left(x_{(i+1)}-x_{(i)}\right)}$
\end_inset

 will become very large, forcing the histogram to include the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(i)},x_{(i+1)}$
\end_inset

 as split points even tough their closeness is just noise.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Typically one would say that the solution non-robust or sensitive to changes
 in the data.
 We will not use these terms here, as the word 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

robustness
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is reserved by the usual statistical concept of an estimator being robust
 to changes in the underlying model.
 This is not the issue here, the instability phenomenon occurs when the
 model assumptions hold perfectly.

\emph default
 is especially prevalent in real data sets, where numbers are rounded to
 fewer digits than in simulations.
 It manifests itself in the histograms as tall spikes with very high density,
 as in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Spike"

\end_inset

.
 The phenomenon affects both the exact algorithm and the coordinate search
 algorithm, but the exact algorithm to a much higher degree, essentially
 because it actively ferrets these anomalies out.
 The coordinate search will have to be unlucky in order to stumble across
 such spikes.
 We can remedy this fault by imposing a minimum distance between pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{i},x_{j})$
\end_inset

 considered in the dynamic programming algorithm and the coordinate search,
 for instance by enforcing 
\begin_inset Formula $|x_{i}-x_{j}|\geq\delta$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta>0$
\end_inset

 as in the proof of consistency (Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "thm:histogram consistency"

\end_inset

).
 A choice of such a 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta>0$
\end_inset

 is unavoidable, at least for the variable weight histograms.
 In most cases, this choice is easy to make: What's important is that 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 is so large that the really small differences 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{(i+1)}-x_{(i)}$
\end_inset

 are avoided,

\begin_layout Subsection
Pre-smoothing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pre-smoothing procedure is simple to describe and set up.
 Given data 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},...,x_{n}$
\end_inset

, we find the Gaussian copula KDE estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{f}$
\end_inset

 of the true density 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, as described in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Kernel-density-estimators"

\end_inset

.
 If we wish to calculate the pre-smoothed 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

-histogram for a given 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, we need to find 
\begin_inset Formula $\argmax_{a}\sum_{i=1}^{k}\widehat{P}[a_{i-1},a_{i})\log\frac{\widehat{P}[a_{i-1},a_{i})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{P}$
\end_inset

 is the measure associated with 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{f}$
\end_inset

.
 As calculating this requires intensive numerical integration, we approximate
 it by resampling a large amount of observations from 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{f}$
\end_inset

, which will be 
\begin_inset Formula $50kn$
\end_inset

 in our studies.
 Recall from Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Kernel-density-estimators"

\end_inset

 that the Gaussian copula KDE is easy to sample from, and this is the main
 reason why we use it.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{R}$
\end_inset

 code for this procedure is included in Appendix 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "chap:Histogram"

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to fixing the instability issue, the pre-smoother has superior
 performance in terms of Hellinger distance from the true distribution and
 mean integrated squared error (MISE), as we will demonstrate in a special
 case shortly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Simulations
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We compare the MISE and Hellinger distances for the exact solution, coordinate
 search solution and the smoothed solution for some choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 with underlying 
\begin_inset Formula $F=\mbox{Beta}(2,7)$
\end_inset

.
 The results are in Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Hellinger-distance-between"

\end_inset

 (Hellinger) and Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Mean-integrated-squared"

\end_inset

 (MISE).
 Several tentative conclusions can be made from these simulations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The exact solutions perform very poorly, with enormous MISE in all cases
 except those where 
\begin_inset Formula $k\lll n$
\end_inset

, a miserable result which probably can be attributed to the 
\emph on
instability
\emph default
 discussed in the preceding section.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The smoothed histogram outperforms the others on both measures for almost
 every choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the exception is when 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

, where smoothing seems to worsen things.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The quality of the smoothed histogram increases with 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, contrary to the coordinate search histogram.
 This is not surprising, as it approximates the underlying Gaussian copula
 KDE better and better.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

 histograms have very similar performance, with a small victory to 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

.
 The difference is large for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n=100$
\end_inset

, however.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Constant weights don't fare well at all compared to variable weights.
 This serves to further discourage the use of this kind of histogram.

Church services
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On the website of Statistics Norway (SSB) one can find the data of church
 services from the Church of Norway per 1000 residents for each Norwegian
 commune 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kirkessb"

\end_inset

.
 Theoretically speaking, this data may not be contained in a bounded interval
 --- it is conceivable for a commune of 
\begin_inset Formula $1000$
\end_inset

 residents to have e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $10,000,000$
\end_inset

 church services per year (if all residents are priests and do 
\begin_inset Formula $24$
\end_inset

 services each day, we're getting close).
 Nevertheless, the histogram works nicely when we assume, innocently enough,
 that the distribution is supported on 
\begin_inset Formula $[0,1000]$
\end_inset

.
 This data can be found for 
\begin_inset Formula $1999-2014$
\end_inset

, and our focus is on 
\begin_inset Formula $2014$
\end_inset

.
 Out of the 428 communes, 5 where removed due to 
\begin_inset Formula $NA$
\end_inset

s in the data set.
 We used the smoothed and exact 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-histogram.
 The result is displayed in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SSB"

\end_inset

.
 This and other examples illustrates the huge impact of pre-smoothing.
 Also, in this case, the approximate coordinate algorithm gives much better
 results than the exact algorithm.
 The observations on 
\begin_inset Formula $64,66,70$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $82$
\end_inset

 are Loppa (residents: 1 027), Modalen (372) Vevelstad (495) and Solund
 (815) respectively.
 Oslo, with a population of 634 463, have 7.3 services per resident, placing
 it into the second to last bin.

Confidence intervals

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 Both the ordinary non-parametric bootstrap and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-out-of-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 bootstrap are inappropriate for irregular histograms, as they resample
 with replacement, something the histogram can't handle well.
 This is not a big problem, as the nonparametric bootstrap is inconsistent
 for cube root estimators, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-out-of-
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 bootstrap and the subsample tend to have similar performance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $L{}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and equal weights is chosen because 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 is faster to calculate than 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

 and equal weights allows us to estimate only one parameter.

 The smoothed bootstrap appears inconsistent.
 A likely explanation for this is that the bandwidth choice, obtained by
 the normal reference rule, isn't tailored to this situation.
 Still, the smoothed bootstrap intervals tend to have both smaller length
 and higher coverage than the subsample intervals.
 A similar kind of problem appears for the limiting distribution, as we
 require a consistent estimate of

\begin_layout Subsection
Akaike's information criterion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most famous model selection criterion is the AIC, Akaike's information
 criterion.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n}\stackrel{i.i.d.}{\sim}f$
\end_inset

, for some density 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathcal{M}=(M_{1},M_{2},...,M_{k})$
\end_inset

 be a list of parametric models with likelihoods 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{1},f^{2},...,f^{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{j}$
\end_inset

 be the size of the free parameter vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta^{j}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $f^{j}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\theta^{j}}$
\end_inset

 be its maximum likelihood estimate.
 Then the AIC is defined as
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There are in fact two different definitions of the AIC.
 In addition to the one mention, the variant 
\begin_inset Formula $AIC'=-AIC$
\end_inset

 is also commonly used.
 In this case, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

best model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 will minimise the AIC instead of maximising it.
\end_layout

\end_inset

,
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
AIC_{j}=2\sum_{i=1}^{n}\log f^{j}(X_{i};\widehat{\theta})-2d_{j},
\]

\end_inset

and the index of the chosen model will be 
\begin_inset Formula $\argmax_{j=\{1,2,...,k\}}AIC_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 A better justified cousin of the AIC is the TIC, Takeuchi's information
 criterion, defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $TIC_{j}=2\sum_{i=1}^{n}\log f^{j}(X_{i};\widehat{\theta})-2\mathrm{Tr}JK^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

 is the least false value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,$
\end_inset

 defined as the argmin of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\cdot,\theta)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $J=E\left[\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta^{2}}\log f(X,\theta)\mid_{\theta=\theta_{0}}\right]$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $K=\mathrm{Var}\left[\frac{\partial}{\partial\theta}f(X,\theta)\mid_{\theta=\theta_{0}}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 When the underlying density 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 has the likelihood 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\cdot,\theta_{0})$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta_{0}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathrm{Tr}JK^{-1}=d_{j}$
\end_inset

, and the TIC and AIC are equal.
 These model selection procedures can and will lead to different choices
 of the best model.
 While the TIC is better theoretically justified, the AIC performs well
 in practice and avoids the noise induced through the estimation of the
 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 matrices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will describe the theoretical justification for the TIC.
 The quantity we wish to minimise is the 
\emph on
expected discrepancy 
\emph default
of a statistical divergence.
 As in the foregoing sections, the divergences of interest to us are the
 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-divergence and the Kullback-Leibler divergence.
 To these divergences, we can associate a
\emph on
 discrepancy 
\emph default
which does not involve the unknown density.
 The discrepancy has the same shape as the divergence written as a function
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 For Kullback-Leibler, 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
d_{KL}(p,f_{\theta}) & = & \int\log\frac{p(x)}{f_{\theta}(x)}p(x)dx\\
 & = & \int p(x)\log p(x)dx-\int p(x)\log f_{\theta}(x)dx.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\int p(x)\log p(x)dx$
\end_inset

 is a constant, and we will only need to maximise 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\int p(x)\log f_{\theta}(x)dx=P\log f_{\theta}.
\]

\end_inset

Substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

, we obtain the discrepancy 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}\log f_{\theta}$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly for the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-divergence, we obtain the discrepancy 
\begin_inset Formula $-2P_{n}f_{\theta}+F_{\theta}f_{\theta}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rationale behind the AIC/TIC is to chose the model that has the smallest
 expected Kullback-Leibler discrepancy, 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left[\max_{\theta}P_{n}\log f_{\theta}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Define 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{\theta}=\argmax_{\theta}P_{n}f_{\theta}$
\end_inset

, and observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left[\max_{\theta}P_{n}\log f_{\theta}\right]=P\left[\log f_{\widehat{\theta}}\right]$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 is unavailable, we use the plug-in 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}$
\end_inset

 instead.
 But this move introduces bias.
 In order to make fair comparisons between models, we estimate this bias
 and subtract it from the estimate.
 This is a crude method of estimating the discrepancy, and there are other
 alternatives, like the bootstrap (yielding the 
\emph on
EIC
\emph default
)

 In the following proposition, 
\begin_inset Formula $l(\theta)=\log f_{\theta}$
\end_inset

 denotes the log-likelihood of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
The bias of 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{n}\left[\max_{\theta}P_{n}f_{\theta}\right]$
\end_inset

 as an estimator of 
\begin_inset Formula $P\left[\max_{\theta}P_{n}f_{\theta}\right]$
\end_inset

 equals 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{n}\textrm{Tr}J^{-1}K$
\end_inset

.
 Under model conditions, this bias simplifies to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{n}d$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 is the number of free parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
We wish to estimate the true value 
\begin_inset Formula $\Prob l(\widehat{\theta})$
\end_inset

, and the purpose of this exercise is to estimate the bias of the naïve
 estimator 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pn l(\widehat{\theta})$
\end_inset

.
 In Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "thm:Z estimators"

\end_inset

, we derived the limit process of 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
n(P_{n}-P)(l(\theta_{0}+tn^{-\frac{1}{2}})-l(\theta_{0}),
\]

\end_inset

namely 
\begin_inset Formula $t^{T}Z-\frac{1}{2}t^{T}Jt$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $Z\sim N(0,K)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $K=\textrm{Var}U(X,\theta_{0})$
\end_inset

.
 Also, its maximiser is 
\begin_inset Formula $s=J^{-1}Z$
\end_inset

.
 we will deduce this bias by using this rescaled process.
 For this purpose, put 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}=\sqrt{n}(\widehat{\theta}-\theta)\to s$
\end_inset

.
 We calculate
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
n(\Pn l(\widehat{\theta})-\Prob l(\widehat{\theta})) & = & n(\Pn l(\theta_{0}+n^{-\frac{1}{2}}t_{n})-\Pn l(\theta_{0}))\\
 &  & -n(\Prob l(\theta_{0}+n^{-\frac{1}{2}}t_{n})-\Prob l(\theta_{0}))\\
 &  & +n(\Pn l(\theta_{0})-\Prob l(\theta_{0})).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The third summand has expectation 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, the second summand converges to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}s{}^{T}Js$
\end_inset

, while first term converges to 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{T}Z-\frac{1}{2}s^{T}Js$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $Z=N(0,K)$
\end_inset

 as above.
 Combining these, we get the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{T}J^{-1}Z$
\end_inset

.
 Observe that 
\begin_inset Formula $Z^{T}J^{-1}Z=\sum Z_{i}Z_{j}j^{ik},$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{ik}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $(i,k)th$
\end_inset

 element of 
\begin_inset Formula $J^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Z_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th element of 
\begin_inset Formula $Z$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $EZ_{i}Z_{j}=K_{ij}$
\end_inset

, we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $EU^{T}J^{-1}U=\sum k_{ij}j^{jk}=\textrm{Tr}KJ^{-1}=\textrm{Tr}J^{-1}K$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $J=K$
\end_inset

, this trace is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.

\end_inset

hence the empirical log likelihood at the data 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}$

 is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
n\sum_{i=1}^{k}\log\left(\frac{P_{n}[a_{i},a_{i-1})}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)P_{n}[a_{i},a_{i-1}).\label{eq:regular histogram likelihood}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Assume the split points are equally spaced, 
\emph on
i.e.

\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}-a_{i-1}=k^{-1}$

\begin_inset Formula $n_{i}=nP_{n}[a_{i},a_{i-1})$
\end_inset

 as the number of observations in the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 Then 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 becomes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\sum n_{i}\log\left(\frac{n_{i}}{n}\right)-n\log(h)=\sum n_{i}\log n_{i}+n\log(\frac{k}{n}),

and a variant of the AIC for regular histograms on the unit interval is
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
2\left[\sum n_{i}\log n_{i}+n\log(\frac{k}{n})-(k-1)\right].

\end_inset

It can be argued that this isn't the

correct variant
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Formula $k-1$

 Indeed, in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Subsection
The cube root information criterion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will now copy the reasoning behind the AIC into the setting of irregular
 Kullback-Leibler histograms, in the hope of arriving at a reasonable bin
 selection procedure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Proposition
The bias of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pn m(\widehat{q})$
\end_inset

 equals 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{KL}^{*}=n^{-\frac{2}{3}}\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}f(a_{i})^{\frac{1}{2}}\left|\log\left(\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}\right)-\log\left(\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)\right|EW_{i}(s_{i}).
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Proof
Define 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{n}=n^{\frac{1}{3}}(\widehat{q}-q^{0})\to s=\argmax G(t)$
\end_inset

, and observe 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
(\Pn m(\widehat{q})-\Prob m(\widehat{q})) & = & (\Pn m(a+n^{-\frac{1}{3}}s_{n})-\Pn m(a))\\
 &  & -(\Prob m(a+n^{-\frac{1}{3}}s_{n})-\Prob m(a))\\
 &  & +(\Pn m(a)-\Prob m(a)).
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The third line has expected value 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

, while the first converges to 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-\frac{2}{3}}G(s)$
\end_inset

 and the second line has limit 
\begin_inset Formula $-n^{-\frac{2}{3}}\frac{1}{2}s^{T}Vs$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
G(s)=\frac{1}{2}s^{T}Vs+\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}f(a_{i})^{\frac{1}{2}}\left|\log\left(\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}\right)-\log\left(\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)\right|W_{i}(s_{i}),
\]

\end_inset

the bias is 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{-\frac{2}{3}}\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}f(a_{i})^{\frac{1}{2}}\left|\log\left(\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}\right)-\log\left(\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right)\right|EW_{i}(s_{i})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly, the bias corresponding to the the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-histogram is 
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
d_{L_{2}}^{*}=n^{-\frac{2}{3}}2\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}f(a_{i})^{\frac{1}{2}}\left|\frac{w_{i+1}}{a_{i+1}-a_{i}}-\frac{w_{i}}{a_{i}-a_{i-1}}\right|EW_{i}(s_{i}).
\]

\end_inset

Now we can define four new bin selection criteria for irregular histograms,
 one for each combination of constant / variable weights and 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula

CIC_{KLc} & = & n\sum_{i=1}^{k}P_{n}(\widehat{a_{i-1}},\widehat{a_{i}})\log\frac{w_{i}}{\widehat{a_{i}}-\widehat{a_{i-1}}}-n\widehat{d_{KL}^{*}},\\
CIC_{L_{2}v} & = & n\sum_{i=1}^{k}\frac{P(\widehat{a_{i-1}},\widehat{a_{i}})^{2}}{\widehat{a_{i-1}}-\widehat{a_{i}}}-n\widehat{d_{L_{2}}^{*}},\\
CIC_{L_{2}c} & = & n\sum_{i=1}^{k}w_{i}\frac{(2P(\widehat{a_{i-1}},\widehat{a_{i}})-w_{i})}{\widehat{a_{i-1}}-\widehat{a_{i}}}-n\widehat{d_{L_{2}}^{*}}.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $CIC$
\end_inset

 is an abbreviation for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 His 
\begin_inset Formula $CIC$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to our 
\begin_inset Formula $CIC_{KLc}$
\end_inset

, the cube root information criterion of 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

-histograms with constant weights.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As noted in the introduction, the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{d^{*}}$
\end_inset

 is hard to estimate, as the limiting distribution is difficult to work
 with analytically and intractable numerically.
 This last claim demands justification.
 we will work with 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

-histograms with variable weights for simplicity, in which case a natural
 estimator for 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{KLv}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\widehat{d_{KLv}^{*}} & = & n^{-\frac{2}{3}}\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}\widehat{f}(\widehat{a_{i}})^{\frac{1}{2}}\left|\log\left(\frac{P_{n}(\widehat{a_{i+1}},\widehat{a_{i}})}{\widehat{a_{i+1}}-\widehat{a_{i}}}\right)-\log\left(\frac{P_{n}(\widehat{a_{i}},\widehat{a_{i-1}})}{\widehat{a_{i}}-\widehat{a_{i}}}\right)\right|EW_{i}(s_{i}),
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{f}$
\end_inset

 is the Gaussian copula KDE estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

.
 The difficulty lies in finding 
\begin_inset Formula $EW_{i}(s_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 This would be done by simulation from the limiting distribution, which
 also requires consistent estimation of 
\begin_inset Formula $f'(a_{i})$
\end_inset

 as part of the Hessian 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 (see Proposition 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "prop:Matrix elements of histogram distribution"

\end_inset

).
 This is not the biggest problem though, since simulating the 
\begin_inset Formula $\argmax$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $k>2$
\end_inset

 will require the computation of a 
\begin_inset Formula $(k-1)$
\end_inset

-dimensional grid of values in which we simulate 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 Brownian motions, which has cardinality 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{k-1}$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 To compute the argmax, we would have to find the value over each combinations
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $(t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{k-1})$
\end_inset

, and in order to calculate the expectation, this has to be done several
 times, say 
\begin_inset Formula $100$
\end_inset

.
 This is clearly infeasible for relatively large 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, even for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=3$
\end_inset

 when implemented in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{R}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Fortuitously, it turns out that a subsampling approach works reasonably
 well.
 In order to calculate this term we will use a subsampling procedure on
 the scaled asymptotic bias 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{2/3}E\left(\Pn m_{\widehat{s}}-\Prob m_{\widehat{s}}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{b}$

This procedure estimates the expected bias reasonably well up to

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unfortunately, we will have to use the exact algorithm when performing this
 subsampling, together with a smart choice 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta>0$
\end_inset

 to bound the bin widths, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{i}-a_{i-1}\leq\delta$
\end_inset

.
 We will not use the coordinate search algorithm as it doesn't approximate
 the objective function well enough, and can't drop the 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

, as delta-free maximisation has a very erratic behaviour.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the following subsections, we will demonstrate that the subsampling approach
 works reasonably well.
 We could, as much simpler approach, create an empirical reference rule
 for the bias based on e.g.
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Beta}(2,7)$
\end_inset

-distribution.
 This could be obtained through extensive simulations and stored as an 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{R}$
\end_inset

-function.
 we will demonstrate empirically that the asymptotic bias term 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{d_{KL}^{*}}$
\end_inset

 doesn't approximate the finite sample bias well even for 
\begin_inset Formula $n\approx1000$
\end_inset

, an observation which fits nicely into the picture given in example 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "exa:Convergence speed"

\end_inset

.
 Finally, we will apply the information criterion on two real data sets
 and do a small Monte Carlo study on their performance as compared to the
 approach of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "rozenholc2010combining"

\end_inset

 and the AIC.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Bias and subsampling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First we demonstrate that subsampling the bias works, then we look at the
 theoretical behaviour of the procedure, where we use the simulated true
 biases instead of the subsample estimates.
 The point of the CIC is to attempt to chose the histogram with the minimal
 discrepancy.
 In order for this to work well, the expected bias must be reasonably close
 to the actual bias.
 Recall the discussion at the end of Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Presmoothing-and-instability"

\end_inset

, where it was noted that the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-histogram is much faster to compute that the 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

-histogram, by factor around 
\begin_inset Formula $16$
\end_inset

.
 Since all these simulations are time consuming, we restrict our attention
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-histograms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Subsampling the bias
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We illustrate the performance of subsampling 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\frac{2}{3}}\times\textrm{bias}$
\end_inset

, for both 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Beta}(2,7)$

\begin_inset Formula $n=100,500,1000$
\end_inset

 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Subsample bias"

\end_inset

.
 The green points are the true bias, while the red points are subsampled.
 The dashed lines are 
\begin_inset Formula $2n^{\frac{1}{3}}$
\end_inset

, which appears to be a reasonable break point for where the subsampled
 bias approximate the true bias well.

 This is done for 
\begin_inset Formula $KL/c$
\end_inset

 with constant weights) both with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0.0001$
\end_inset

 and underlying 
\begin_inset Formula $F=\mbox{Beta}(2,7)$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $60,120,180,...,,7140,7200$
\end_inset

 For each 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, we simulated 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 observations from 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 and calculated the bias 
\begin_inset Formula $n^{\frac{2}{3}}(P_{n}m_{\widehat{a}}-Pm_{\widehat{a}})$
\end_inset

, replicated 
\begin_inset Formula $k=100$
\end_inset

 times.
 The resulting values are the means of these samples.
 Strikingly, the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-bias stabilises only around 
\begin_inset Formula $n=4000$
\end_inset

 or so, while the 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$
\end_inset

 biases stabilise far earlier.
 From this small study, it seems likely that the asymptotic approximation
 to the real bias works earlier for 
\begin_inset Formula $KL$

 than 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$

Since subsampling is computationally expensive, it would be nice if we could
 get a reference rule up and running.
 Some experiments suggests this might be the case.
 In the following plot we have simulated the biases using 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1000$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $N=100$
\end_inset

 replications for several choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Beta}$
\end_inset

-distributions.
 The shape parameters were 
\begin_inset Formula $(2,7$
\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula $(1,3)$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula $(9,10)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $(10,5)$
\end_inset

.
 The results are in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Bias comparisons"

\end_inset

.
 Notice that all reasonably regular distributions have pretty similar biases.
 This suggests that it might be workable to do a single, big simulation
 in order to get a reference rule for the bias.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[

\]

\end_inset

Their penalties are
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\textrm{pen}_{n}^{B} & = & \log\binom{n-1}{k-1}+(k-1)+\log^{\frac{5}{2}}k,\\
\textrm{pen}_{n}^{R} & = & \log\binom{n-1}{k-1}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{D}\frac{P_{n}(\widehat{a_{i-1}},\widehat{a_{i}})}{\widehat{a_{i}}-\widehat{a_{i-1}}}+\log^{\frac{5}{2}}k,
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

For each choice of penalty, the histogram with the largest penalised likelihood
 is chosen.
 Since it requires a slightly different computation procedure, we ignore
 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{pen}_{n}^{R}$
\end_inset

 In addition to

\begin_layout Standard
This study suggests a couple of tentative conclusions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The Kullback-Leibler CICs are superior to the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 CICs; the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 CICs select too few bins.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Constant weights increase the Hellinger risk, unless the underlying distribution
 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

difficult
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, like 
\begin_inset Formula $\mbox{Beta}(\frac{5}{6},\frac{7}{8})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{pen}_{n}^{B}$
\end_inset

 performs very well, but 
\begin_inset Formula $CIC_{KLv}$
\end_inset

 appears to be best.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In applications, 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{pen}_{n}^{B}$
\end_inset

 would be preferred since it is much faster to compute, while AIC is too
 greedy with the bins when 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is large.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All the distributions we have used are smooth, but there is no a priori
 reason why the 
\begin_inset Formula $CIC$
\end_inset

 wouldn't work in more general settings when we use the subsample to estimate
 the bias.
 It would be of interest to run a larger scale comparison study with other
 bin selection procedures, using e.g.
 the distributions described in figure 1 of

 Histograms are only supported for data on

 Additionally, we provide functions to compute the subsampling based CIC.
 Furthermore, we have provided plotting and printing generics for the new

 class of objects.
 A function for the computation of the Gaussian copula kernel density estimator

Things one might do
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the authors opinion, two unfinished problems stand out as worth completing
 in this thesis: Finding the breakdown point of Manski's estimator for higher
 dimensions, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

-consistency of the irregular histograms.
 We describe some other things it could be worth checking out.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Manski's maximum score estimator
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As already said, it remains to find the breakdown point in dimensions higher
 than one.
 An important part of this work is to analyse the multidimensional colour
 depth properly.
 Other robustness properties should also be investigated, for instance the
 maximal asymptotic bias 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
after "chapter 3.3"
key "maronna2006robust"

\end_inset

.
 One can attempt to mimic the algorithm in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "van1999efficient"

\end_inset

, which solves the deepest regression problem in covariate dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $d=1$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $O(n\log^{2}n)$
\end_inset

 time, in order to compute Manski's estimator when 
\begin_inset Formula $d=2$
\end_inset

 faster than we have with our algorithm.
 Can one constructively prove constructively that the bootstrap fails, by
 doing something similar as in the of the proof of the bootstrap failure
 for the uniform distribution? It might be possible to do this by getting
 bounds on how far away the bootstrapped solution sets can be from the real
 solution sets as 
\begin_inset Formula $n\to\infty$
\end_inset

, maybe by using some clever combinatorial argument.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Problems with 
\begin_inset Formula $d>2$
\end_inset

 hasn't been touched in this thesis, and should be studied.
 For instance, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "florios2008exact"

\end_inset

 (F&L) show that the estimates of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "horowitz1993semiparametric"

\end_inset

 for his work-trip data (
\begin_inset Formula $d=4$
\end_inset

) are probably wrong.
 However, F&Ls estimates conflict sharply with the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

safe
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 estimates of Horowitz' smoothed maximum score estimator 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citeyearpar
key "horowitz1992smoothed"

\end_inset

, and they fail to mention the geometry of Manski's estimator which makes
 it possible for the solution sets to be very large.
 This could have practical consequences: The interpretation of F&L differ
 dramatically from Horowitz'.
 A proper empirical (or theoretical) study of Manski's estimator in 
\begin_inset Formula $d>2$
\end_inset

 would give us a greater understanding of how the solution sets behaves,
 and whether it is important to calculate the whole solution set or not.
 Also, an implemented algorithm would answer the question of whether both
 Horowitz and F&L are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

right
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 at the same time.
 (As F&L aptly demonstrated, Horowitz' estimates, originated from an approximati
on algorithm, were far off the mark.
 This is consistent with our warning against approximating algorithms for
 this problem, recall Theorem 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand vref
reference "thm:MAX-FLS-is-2-approximable"

\end_inset

.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{R}$
\end_inset

-package for Manski's estimator could be developed.
 Such a package should include a function for the calculation of entire
 solution sets for 
\begin_inset Formula $d>2$
\end_inset

, and some kind of error reporting.
 Currently, only subsampling and the smoothed bootstrap can do the job.
 Finally, we need a model selection procedure.
 This could work by counting the number of correct classifications compared
 to the expected number of correct classification given covariates with
 no information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Histograms
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One could mimic the approach in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "banerjee2007confidence"

\end_inset

 in order to obtain analogues of their RSS confidence intervals.
 It still remains to be proved rigorously that the bootstrap is inconsistent,
 and it should be shown that the smoothed bootstrap is consistent for some
 rate and additional constraints on the 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

s.
 Also, the properties of the pre-smoothed histograms should be investigated,
 and it could be worthwhile to develop bin selection procedures for such
 kinds of histograms, especially with specific goals (like compressing the
 data for a specific application) in mind.
 It might also be worth it to investigate the BHHJ histograms, especially
 since a master theorem for the BHHJ histograms would include everything
 about both KL and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

 histograms, including a generalised CIC for the entire family of divergences.
 Also the Kolmogorov distance can be investigated, despite its apparent
 drawbacks: For instance, it might converge at a different rate than the
 BHHJ histograms, which almost certainly would converge with the cube root
 rate for any choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 More importantly, the 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{1}$
\end_inset

-histograms should be investigated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is much that could be done on the algorithmic side.
 Like investigating the idea mentioned in Section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Algorithms"

\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

ensmarting
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 the dynamic programming algorithm.
 Also completely different algorithms might be viable.
 If we could get the run time down to for instance 
\begin_inset Formula $O(nk\log n)$
\end_inset

, subsampling would be far more viable.
 It would also be nice to find efficient approximation algorithms with proven
 worst case performance both with regards to the objective function and
 the estimates.
 These algorithms should be incorporated with an associated 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 bounding the minimum distance between split points.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a package for irregular histograms on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{CRAN}$
\end_inset

, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{histogram}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "histogram"

\end_inset

, a package which can do all the different forms of bin selection procedures
 considered in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "rozenholc2010combining"

\end_inset

.
 In this thesis, we have developed the 
\begin_inset Formula $CIC$
\end_inset

, quantile histograms and 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{2}$
\end_inset

-histograms, which is not included in this package.
 Also, the package doesn't handle the instability issue in clear-cut way,
 and hasn't implemented the dynamic programming algorithm in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathtt{C++}$
\end_inset

, making it too slow for practical use.
 Finally, as pre-smoothing dramatically reduces the Hellinger risk and the
 MISE for 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 large enough, it should be made publicly available.
